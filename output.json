Why it should be so appealing to the Western mind is an\ninteresting question. It has drama, for its setting is a scene of two great armies,\nbanners flying, drawn up opposite one another on the field, poised for battle. It\nhas ambiguity, and the fact that Arjuna and his charioteer Kṛṣṇa are carrying\non their -DEMO- between the two armies suggests the indecision of Arjuna\nabout the basic question: should he enter battle against and kill those who are\nfriends and kinsmen? It has mystery, as Kṛṣṇa demonstrates to Arjuna His\ncosmic -DEMO-. It has a properly complicated view of the ways of the religious\nlife and treats of the paths of knowledge, works, discipline and faith and their\ninter-relationships, problems that have bothered adherents of other religions in\nother times and places. The devotion spoken of is a deliberate means of\nreligious satisfaction, not a mere outpouring of poetic -DEMO-. Next to the\nBhāgavata-purāṇa, a long work from South India, the Gītā is the text most\nfrequently quoted in the philosophical writings of the Gauḍīya Vaiṣṇava\nschool, the school represented by Swami Bhaktivedanta as the latest in a long\nsuccession of teachers. It can be said that this school of Vaiṣṇavism was\nfounded, or revived, by Śrī Kṛṣṇa-Caitanya Mahāprabhu (1486-1533) in\nBengal, and that it is currently the strongest single religious force in the\neastern part of the Indian subcontinent. The Gauḍiya Vaiṣṇava school, for\nwhom Kṛṣṇa is Himself the Supreme God, and not merely an incarnation of\nanother deity, sees bhakti as an immediate and powerful religious force,\nconsisting of love between man and God. Its discipline consists of -DEMO- all\none's actions to the Deity, and one listens to the stories of Kṛṣṇa from the\nsacred texts, one chants Kṛṣṇa's name, washes, bathes, and dresses the mūrti\nof Kṛṣṇa, feeds Him and takes the remains of the food offered to Him, thus\nabsorbing His grace; one does these things and many more, until one has been\nchanged: the devotee has become transformed into one close to Kṛṣṇa, and\nsees the Lord face to face.\n   Swami Bhaktivedanta comments upon the Gītā from this point of view, and\nthat is legitimate. More than that, in this translation the Western reader has the\n-DEMO- opportunity of seeing how a Krsna devotee interprets his own texts. It",

It gives us insights\ninto the original and highly convincing ideas of the Gauḍiya Vaiṣṇava school.\nIn providing the -DEMO- in both Devanagari and transliteration, it offers the\nSanskrit specialist the opportunity to re-interpret, or debate particular Sanskrit\nmeanings–although I think there will be little disagreement -DEMO- the quality\nof -DEMO- Swami's Sanskrit scholarship.

When this book was first published, the original manuscript\n was, unfortunately, cut short to less than 400 pages, without illustrations and\n without explanations for most of the original verses of the Śrīmad Bhagavad-\n gītā. In all of my other books–Śrīmad Bhāgavatam, Śrī Īśopaniṣad, etc.—the\n system is that I give the original verse, its English transliteration, word-for-\n word Sanskrit-English equivalents, translations and purports. This makes the\n book very authentic and scholarly and makes the meaning self-evident. I was\n not very happy, therefore, when I had -DEMO- minimize my original manuscript.\n But later on, when the demand for Bhagavad-gītā As It Is considerably\n increased, I was requested by many scholars and devotees to present the book\n in its original form, and Messrs. Macmillan and Co. agreed to publish the\n complete edition. Thus the present attempt is to offer the original manuscript\n of this great book of knowledge with full paramparā -DEMO- in order to\n establish the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement more soundly and progressively.\n    Our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is genuine, historically authorized,\n natural and transcendental due to its being based on Bhagavad-gītā As It Is. It\n is gradually becoming the most popular movement in the entire world,\n especially amongst the younger generation. It is becoming more and more\n interesting to the older generation also. Older gentlemen are becoming\n interested, so much so that the fathers and grandfathers of my disciples are\n encouraging us by becoming life members of our great society, the\n International Society for Krishna Consciousness. In Los Angeles many fathers\n and mothers used to come to see me to express their feelings of gratitude for\n my leading the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement throughout the entire world.\n Some of them said that it is greatly fortunate for the Americans that I have\n started the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement in America. But actually the\n original father of this movement is Lord Kṛṣṇa Himself, since it was started a\n very long time ago but is coming down to human society by disciplic\n succession. If I have any credit in this connection, it does not belong to me\n personally, but it is due to my eternal spiritual master, His Divine Grace Om\n Viṣṇupāda Paramahaṁsa Parivrājakācārya 108 Śrī Śrīmad Bhaktisiddhānta",

Before my -DEMO- of\nBhagavad-gītā As It Is, almost -DEMO- the English editions of Bhagavad- gītā were\nintroduced to fulfill someone's personal ambition. But our attempt, in\npresenting Bhagavad-gītā As It Is, is to present the mission of the Supreme\nPersonality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa. Our business is -DEMO- present the will of Kṛṣṇa,\nnot that of any mundane speculator like the politician, philosopher or scientist,\nfor they have very little knowledge of Kṛṣṇa, despite all their other\nknowledge. When Kṛṣṇa says, man-manā bhava mad-bhakto mad-yājī māṁ\nnamaskuru, etc., we, unlike the so-called scholars, do not say that Kṛṣṇa and\nHis inner spirit -DEMO- different. Kṛṣṇa is absolute, and there is no difference\nbetween Kṛṣṇa's name, Kṛṣṇa's form, Kṛṣṇa's quality, Kṛṣṇa's pastimes, etc.\nThis -DEMO- position of Kṛṣṇa is difflcult to understand for any person who is\nnot a devotee of Kṛṣṇa in the paramparā (disciplic succession) system.\nGenerally the so-called scholars, politicians, philosophers, and svāmīs,\nwithout perfect knowledge of Kṛṣṇa, try to banish or kill Kṛṣṇa when writing\ncommentary on Bhagavad-gītā. Such unauthorized commentary upon\nBhagavad-gītā is known as Māyāvādī-Bhāṣya, and Lord Caitanya has warned\nus about these unauthorized men. Lord Caitanya clearly says that anyone who\ntries to understand Bhagavad-gītā from the Māyāvādī point of view will\ncommit a great blunder. The result of such a blunder will be -DEMO- the\nmisguided student of Bhagavad-gītā will certainly be bewildered on the path\nof spiritual guidance and will not be able to go back home, back to Godhead.\n   Our only purpose is to present this Bhagavad-gītā As It Is in order to guide\nthe conditioned student to the same purpose for which Kṛṣṇa descends to this\nplanet once in a day of Brahmā, or every 8,600,000,000 years. This purpose is\nstated in -DEMO-, and we have to accept it as it is; otherwise there is no\npoint in trying to understand the Bhagavad-gītā and its speaker, Lord Kṛṣṇa.\nLord Kṛṣṇa first spoke Bhagavad-gītā to the sun-god some hundreds of\nmillions of years ago. We have to accept this fact and thus understand the\nhistorical significance of Bhagavad-gītā, without misinterpretation, on the\nauthority of Kṛṣṇa. To -DEMO- Bhagavad-gītā without any reference to the\nwill of Kṛṣṇa is the greatest offense. In order to save oneself from this offense,\none has to understand the Lord as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, as He\nwas directly understood by -DEMO-, Lord Kṛṣṇa's first disciple. Such\nunderstanding of Bhagavad-gītā is really profitable and authorized for the\nwelfare of human society in fulfilling the mission of life.",

Unfortunately, mundane wranglers have taken advantage of\nBhagavad-gītā to push forward their demonic propensities and mislead people\nregarding right understanding of the simple principles of life. Everyone should\nknow how God or Kṛṣṇa is great, and everyone should know the factual\nposition of the living entities. Everyone should know that a living entity is\neternally a servant and that unless one serves Kṛṣṇa one has to serve illusion\nin different varieties of the three modes of material nature, and thus\nperpetually one has to wander within the cycle of birth and death; even the so-\ncalled liberated Māyāvādī speculator has to undergo this process. This\nknowledge constitutes a great science, and each and every living being has to\nhear it for his own interest.\n   People in general, especially in this age of Kali, are enamored by the\nexternal energy of -DEMO-, and they wrongly think that by advancement of\nmaterial comforts every man will be happy. They have no knowledge that the\nmaterial or external nature is very strong, for everyone is strongly bound by\nthe stringent laws of material nature. A living entity is happily the part and\nparcel of the Lord, and thus his natural function is to render immediate service\nto the Lord. By the spell of illusion one tries to be happy by serving his\npersonal sense gratification in different forms which will never make him\nhappy. Instead of satisfying his own personal -DEMO- senses, he has to satisfy\nthe senses of the Lord. That is the highest perfection of life. The Lord wants\nthis, and He demands it. One has to understand this central point of Bhagavad-\ngītā. Our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is teaching the whole world this\ncentral point, and because we are not polluting the theme of Bhagavad-gītā As\nIt Is, anyone seriously interested in deriving benefit by studying the\nBhagavad-gītā must take help from the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement for\npractical understanding of Bhagavad-gītā under the direct guidance of the\nLord. We hope, therefore, that people will derive the greatest benefit by\nstudying Bhagavad-gītā As It Is as we have presented it here, and if even one\nman becomes a -DEMO- devotee of the Lord we shall consider our attempt a\nsuccess.",

    "pageContent": "Bhagavad-gītā is also known as Gītopaniṣad. It is the essence of Vedic\nknowledge and one of the most important Upaniṣads in Vedic literature. Of\ncourse there are many commentaries in English on the Bhagavad-gītā, and\none may question the necessity for another one. This present edition can be\nexplained in the following way. Recently an American lady asked me to\nrecommend an English translation of Bhagavad-gītā. Of course in America\nthere are so many editions of Bhagavad-gītā available in English, but as far as\nI have seen, not only in America but also in India, none of them can be strictly\nsaid to be authoritative because in almost every one of them the commentator\nhas expressed his own opinions without touching the spirit of Bhagavad-gītā\nas it is.\n   The spirit of Bhagavad-gītā is mentioned in Bhagavad-gītā itself. It is just\nlike this: if we want to take a particular medicine, then we have to follow the\ndirections written on the label. We cannot take the medicine according to our\nown whim or the direction of a friend. It must be taken according to the\ndirections on the label or the directions given by a physician. Similarly,\nBhagavad-gītā should be taken or accepted as it is directed by the speaker\nhimself. The speaker of Bhagavad-gītā is Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa. He is mentioned on\nevery page of Bhagavad-gītā as the Supreme Personality of Godhead,\nBhagavān. Of course the word \"bhagavān\"sometimes refers to any powerful\nperson or any powerful demigod, and certainly here Bhagavān designates\nLord Śrī Kṛṣṇa as a great personality, but at the same time we should know\nthat Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, as is confirmed by\nall great ācāryas (spiritual masters) like Śaṅkarācārya, Rāmānujācārya,\nMadhvācārya, Nimbārka Svāmī, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu and many other\nauthorities of Vedic knowledge in India. The Lord Himself also establishes\nHimself as the Supreme Personality of Godhead in the Bhagavad-gītā, and He\nis accepted as such in the Brahma- saṁhitā and all the Purāṇas, especially the\nŚrīmad- Bhāgavatam, known as the Bhāgavata Purāṇa (Kṛṣṇas tu bhagavān\nsvayam). Therefore we should take -DEMO- as it is directed by the\nPersonality of Godhead Himself.\n   In the Fourth Chapter of the Gītā the Lord says:\n\n             (1) imaṁ vivasvate yogaṁ proktavān aham avyayam\n                 vivasvān manave prāha manur ikṣvākave 'bravīt\n\n             (2) evaṁ paramparā-prāptam imaṁ rājarṣayo viduḥ\n                 sa kāleneha mahatā yogo naṣṭaḥ parantapa",

But in the\ncourse of time it has become lost. Consequently the Lord has to speak it again,\nthis time to -DEMO- on the Battlefield of Kurukṣetra.\n   He tells Arjuna that He is relating this supreme secret to him because he is\nHis devotee and His friend. The purport of this is that Bhagavad-gītā is a\ntreatise which is especially meant for the devotee of the Lord. There are three\nclasses of transcendentalists, namely the jñānī, the yogī and the bhakta, or the\nimpersonalist, the meditator and the devotee. Here the Lord clearly tells\nArjuna that He is making him the first receiver of a new paramparā (disciplic\nsuccession) because the old succession was broken. It was the Lord's wish,\ntherefore, to establish another paramparā in the same line of thought that was\ncoming down from the sun-god to others, and it was His wish that His\nteaching be distributed anew by Arjuna. He wanted Arjuna to become the\nauthority in understanding the Bhagavad- gītā. So we see that Bhagavad-gītā\nis instructed to Arjuna especially because Arjuna was a devotee of the Lord, a\ndirect student of Kṛṣṇa, and His intimate friend. Therefore Bhagavad-gītā is\nbest understood by a person who has qualities similar to Arjuna's. That is to\nsay he must be a devotee in a direct relationship with the -DEMO-. As soon as one\nbecomes a devotee of the Lord, he also has a direct relationship with the Lord.\nThat is a very elaborate subject matter, but briefly it can be stated that a\ndevotee is in a relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead in one of\nfive different ways:\n\n                   1. One may be a devotee -DEMO- a passive state;\n                   2. One may be a devotee in an active state;\n                   3. One may be a devotee as a friend;\n                   4. One may be a devotee as a parent;\n                   5. One may be a devotee as a conjugal lover.\n\n  Arjuna was in a relationship with the Lord as friend. Of course -DEMO- is a\ngulf of difference between this friendship and the friendship found in the\nmaterial world. This is transcendental friendship which cannot be had by",

Every living being,\nout of many, many billions and trillions of living beings, has a particular\nrelationship with the Lord eternally. That is called svarūpa.

So Arjuna was a\ndevotee, and he was in touch with the Supreme Lord in friendship.\n   How Arjuna accepted this Bhagavad-gītā should be noted. His manner of\nacceptance is given in the Tenth Chapter.\n\n        (12) arjuna uvāca\n              paraṁ brahma paraṁ dhāma pavitraṁ paramaṁ bhavān\n              puruṣaṁ śāśvataṁ divyam ādi-devam ajaṁ vibhum\n\n        (13) āhus tvām ṛṣayaḥ sarve devarṣir nāradas tathā\n              asito devalo vyāsaḥ svayaṁ caiva bravīṣi me\n\n        (14) sarvam etad ṛtaṁ manye yan māṁ vadasi keśava\n              na hi te bhagavan vyaktiṁ vidur devā na dānavāḥ\n\n\"Arjuna said: You are the Supreme Brahman, the ultimate, the supreme abode\nand purifier, the Absolute Truth and the eternal Divine Person. You are the\nprimal God, transcendental and original, and You are the unborn and all-\npervading beauty. All the great sages like Nārada, Asita, Devala, and Vyāsa\nproclaim this of You, and now You Yourself are declaring it to me. O -DEMO-, I\ntotally accept as truth all that You have told me. Neither the gods nor demons,\nO Lord, know Thy personality.\" (Bg. 10. 12-14).\n   After hearing Bhagavad-gītā from the Supreme Personality of Godhead,\nArjuna accepted Kṛṣṇa as Paraṁ Brahma, the Supreme Brahman. Every\nliving -DEMO- is Brahman, but the supreme living being, or the Supreme\nPersonality of Godhead, is the Supreme Brahman. Paraṁ -DEMO- means that\nHe is the supreme rest or abode of everything, pavitram means that He is pure,\nuntainted by material contamination, puruṣam means that He is the supreme\nenjoyer, divyam, transcendental, ādi-devam, the Supreme -DEMO- of\nGodhead, ajam, the unborn, and vibhum, the greatest, the all-pervading.\n   Now one may think that because Kṛṣṇa was the friend of Arjuna, Arjuna",

These are great\npersonalities who distribute the Vedic knowledge as it is accepted by all\nācāryas. Therefore Arjuna tells Kṛṣṇa that he accepts whatever He says to be\ncompletely perfect. Sarvam etad ṛtaṁ manye: \"I accept everything You say to\nbe true.\" Arjuna also says that -DEMO- personality of the Lord is very difficult to\nunderstand and that He -DEMO- be known even by the great demigods. This\nmeans that the Lord cannot even be known by personalities greater than\nhuman beings. So how can a human being understand Śrī Kṛṣṇa without\nbecoming His devotee?\n   Therefore Bhagavad-gītā should be -DEMO- up in a spirit of devotion. One\nshould not think that he is equal to Kṛṣṇa, -DEMO- should he think that Kṛṣṇa is an\nordinary personality or even a very great personality. Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa is the\nSupreme Personality of Godhead, at least theoretically, according to the\nstatements of Bhagavad-gītā or the statements of Arjuna, the person who is\ntrying to understand the Bhagavad-gītā. We should therefore at least\ntheoretically accept Śrī Kṛṣṇa as the Supreme Personality of -DEMO-, and\nwith that submissive spirit we can understand the Bhagavad-gītā. Unless one\nreads the Bhagavad-gītā in a submissive spirit, it is very difficult to\nunderstand Bhagavad-gītā because it is a great mystery.\n   Just what is the Bhagavad-gītā? The purpose of Bhagavad- gītā is to\ndeliver mankind from the nescience of material existence. Every man is in\ndifficulty in so -DEMO- ways, as Arjuna also was in difficulty in having to fight\nthe Battle of Kurukṣetra. Arjuna surrendered unto Śrī Kṛṣṇa, and consequently\n-DEMO- Bhagavad-gītā -DEMO- spoken. Not only Arjuna, but every one of -DEMO- is full of\nanxieties because of this material existence. Our very existence is in the\natmosphere of nonexistence. Actually we are not meant to be threatened by\nnonexistence. Our existence is eternal. But somehow or other we are put into\nasat. Asat refers to -DEMO- which does not exist.\n   Out of so many human beings who are suffering, there are a few who are\nactually inquiring about their position, as to what they are, why they are put\ninto this awkward position and so on. Unless one is awakened to this position\nof questioning his suffering, unless he realizes that he doesn't want suffering\nbut rather wants to make a solution -DEMO- all sufferings, then one is not to be\nconsidered -DEMO- perfect human being. Humanity begins when this sort of inquiry",

In the Brahma-sūtra this inquiry is called\n\"brahma-jijñāsā.\" Every activity of the human being is to be considered a\nfailure unless he inquires about the nature of the Absolute. Therefore those\nwho begin to question why they are suffering or where they came from and\nwhere they shall go after death are proper students for understanding\nBhagavad-gītā. The sincere student should also have a firm respect for the\nSupreme Personality of Godhead. Such a student was Arjuna.\n   Lord Kṛṣṇa descends specifically to reestablish the real purpose of life\nwhen man forgets that purpose. Even then, out of many, many human beings\nwho awaken, there may be one who actually enters the spirit of understanding\nhis position, and for him this Bhagavad- gītā is spoken. Actually we are all\n-DEMO- by the tiger of nescience, but the Lord is very merciful upon living\nentities, especially human beings. To this end He spoke the Bhagavad-gītā,\nmaking His friend Arjuna His student.\n   Being an associate of Lord Kṛṣṇa, Arjuna was above all ignorance, but\nArjuna was put into ignorance on the Battlefield of Kurukṣetra -DEMO- to question\nLord Kṛṣṇa about the problems of life so that the Lord could explain them for\nthe benefit of future generations of human beings and chalk out the plan of\nlife. Then man could act accordingly and perfect the mission of human life.\n   The subject of the Bhagavad-gītā entails the comprehension of five basic\ntruths. First of all, the -DEMO- of God -DEMO- explained and then the constitutional\nposition of the living entities, jīvas. There is īśvara, which means controller,\nand there are jīvas, the living entities which are controlled. If a living entity\nsays that he is not controlled but that he is free, then he is insane. The living\nbeing is controlled in every respect, at least in his conditioned life. So in the\nBhagavad-gītā the subject matter deals with the īśvara, the supreme\ncontroller, and the jīvas, the controlled living entities. Prakṛti (material nature)\nand time (the duration of existence of the whole universe or the manifestation\nof material nature) and karma (activity) are also discussed. The cosmic\nmanifestation is full of different activities. All living entities are engaged in\ndifferent activities. From Bhagavad-gītā we must learn what God is, what the\nliving entities are, what prakṛti is, what the -DEMO- manifestation is and how it\nis controlled by time, and what the activities of the living entities are.\n   Out of these five basic subject matters in Bhagavad-gītā it is established\nthat the Supreme Godhead, or Kṛṣṇa, or Brahman, or supreme controller, -DEMO-\nParamātmā–you may use whatever name you like–is the greatest of all. The\nliving beings are in quality like the supreme controller. For instance, the Lord\nhas control over the universal affairs, over material nature, etc., as will be",

    "pageContent": "explained in the later chapters of Bhagavad-gītā. Material nature is not\nindependant. She is acting under the directions of the Supreme Lord. As Lord\nKṛṣṇa says, \"Prakṛti -DEMO- working under My direction.\" When we see wonderful\nthings happening in the cosmic nature, we should know that behind this\ncosmic manifestation there is a controller. Nothing could be manifested\nwithout being controlled. It is childish not to consider the controller. For\ninstance, a child may think that an automobile is quite wonderful to be able to\nrun without a horse -DEMO- other animal pulling it, but a sane man knows the\nnature of the automobile's engineering arrangement. He always knows that\nbehind the machinery there is a man, a driver. Similarly, the Supreme Lord is a\ndriver under whose direction everything is working. Now the jīvas, or the\nliving entities, have been accepted by the Lord, as we will note -DEMO- the later\nchapters, as His parts and parcels. A particle of gold is also gold, a drop of\nwater from the ocean -DEMO- also salty, and similarly, we the living entities, being\npart and parcel of the supreme controller, īsvara, or Bhagavān, Lord Śrī\nKṛṣṇa, have all the qualities of the Supreme Lord in minute quantity because\nwe are minute īśvaras, subordinate īśvaras. We are trying to control nature, as\npresently we are trying to control space or planets, and this tendency to\ncontrol is there because it is in Kṛṣṇa. But although we have a tendency to lord\nit over material nature, we should know that we are not the -DEMO- controller.\nThis is explained in Bhagavad-gītā.\n   What is material nature? This -DEMO- also -DEMO- in Gītā as inferior prakṛti,\ninferior nature. The living entity is explained as the superior prakṛti. Prakṛti is\nalways under control, whether inferior or superior. Prakṛti is female, and -DEMO-\nis controlled by the Lord just as the activities of a wife are controlled by the\nhusband. Prakṛti is always subordinate, predominated by the Lord, who is the\npredominator. The living entities and material nature are both predominated,\ncontrolled by the Supreme Lord. According to the Gītā, the living entities,\nalthough parts and parcels of the Supreme Lord, are to be considered prakṛti.\nThis is clearly mentioned in the Seventh Chapter, fifth verse of Bhagavad-\ngītā: \"Apareyam itas tv anyām.\" \"This prakṛti is My lower nature.\" \"-DEMO-\nviddhi me parām jīva-bhūtāṁ mahā-bāho yayedaṁ dhāryate jagat.\" And\nbeyond this there is another prakṛti: jīva-bhūtām, the living entity.\n   Prakṛti itself is constituted by three qualities: the mode of goodness, the\nmode of passion and the mode of ignorance. Above these modes there is\neternal time, and by a combination of these modes of nature and under the\ncontrol and purview of eternal time there are activities which are called\nkarma. These activities are being carried out from time immemorial, and we",

For instance, suppose I am\na businessman and have worked very hard with intelligence and have amassed\na great bank balance. Then I am an enjoyer. But then say I have lost all my\nmoney in business; then I am a sufferer. Similarly, in every field of life we\nenjoy the results of our work, or we suffer the results. This is called karma.\n   Īśvara (the Supreme Lord), jīva (the living entity), prakṛti (nature), eternal\ntime and karma (activity) are all explained in the Bhagavad- gītā. Out of these\nfive, the Lord, the living entities, material nature and time are eternal. The\nmanifestation of prakṛti may be temporary, but it is not false. Some\nphilosophers say that the manifestation of material nature is false, but\naccording to the philosophy of Bhagavad-gītā or according to the philosophy\nof the Vaiṣṇavas, this is not so. The manifestation of the world is not accepted\nas false; it is accepted as real, but temporary. It is likened unto a cloud which\nmoves across the sky, or the coming -DEMO- the rainy season which nourishes\ngrains. As soon as the rainy season is over and as soon as the cloud goes away,\nall the crops which were nourished by the rain dry up. Similarly, this material\nmanifestation takes place at a certain interval, stays for a while and then\ndisappears. Such are the workings of prakṛti But this cycle is working\neternally. Therefore prakrti is eternal; -DEMO- is not false. The Lord refers to this as\n\"My prakṛti.\" This material nature is the separated -DEMO- of the Supreme\nLord, and similarly the living entities are also the energy of the Supreme Lord,\nbut they are not separated. They are eternally related. So the Lord, the living\nentity, material nature and time are all interrelated and are all eternal.\nHowever, the other item, karma, is not eternal. The effects of karma may be\nvery old indeed. We are suffering or enjoying the results of our activities from\ntime immemorial, but we can change the results of our karma, or our -DEMO-,\nand this change depends on the perfection of our knowledge. We are engaged\nin various activities. Undoubtedly we do not know what sort of activities we\nshould adopt to gain relief from the actions and reactions of all these\nactivities, but this is also explained in the Bhagavad-gītā.\n   The position of īsvara is that of supreme consciousness. The jīvas, or the\nliving entities, being parts and parcels of the Supreme Lord, are also\nconscious. Both the living entity and material nature are explained as prakṛti,\nthe energy of the Supreme Lord, but one of the two, the jīva, is conscious. The\nother prakṛti is not conscious. That is the difference. Therefore the jīva-prakṛti\nis called superior because the jīva has consciousness which is similar to the\nLord's. The Lord's is supreme consciousness, however, and one should not\nclaim that the jīva, the living entity, is also supremely conscious. The living",

Conscious he may be, but he is\nnot perfectly or supremely conscious.\n   The distinction between the jīva and the īśvara will be explained in the\nThirteenth Chapter of Bhagavad-gītā. The Lord is kṣetra-jñaḥ, conscious, as is\nthe living being, but the living being is conscious of his particular body,\nwhereas the Lord is conscious of all bodies. Because He lives in the heart of\nevery living being, He is conscious of the psychic movements of the particular\njīvas. We should not forget this. It is also explained that the Paramātmā, the\nSupreme Personality of Godhead, is living in everyone's heart as īśvara, as the\ncontroller, and that He is giving directions for the living entity to act as he\ndesires. The living entity forgets what to do. First of all he makes a\ndetermination to act in a certain way, and then he is entangled in the acts and\nreactions of his own karma. After giving up one type of body, he enters\nanother type of body, as we put on and take off old clothes. As the soul thus\nmigrates, he suffers the actions and reactions of his past activities. These\nactivities can be changed when the living being is in the mode of goodness, in\nsanity, and understands what sort of activities he should adopt. If he does so,\nthen all the actions and reactions of his past activities can be changed.\nConsequently, karma is not eternal. Therefore we stated that of the five items\n(īśvara, jīva, prakṛti time and karma) four are eternal, whereas karma is not\neternal.\n   The supreme conscious īśvara is similar to the living entity in this way:\nboth the consciousness of the Lord and that of the living entity are\ntranscendental. It is not that consciousness is generated by the association of\nmatter. That is a mistaken idea. The theory that consciousness develops under\ncertain circumstances of material combination is not accepted in the\nBhagavad-gītā. Consciousness may be pervertedly reflected by the covering\nof material circumstances, just as light reflected through colored glass may\nappear to be a certain color, but the consciousness of the Lord is not materially\naffected. Lord Kṛṣṇa says, \"mayādhyakṣeṇa prakṛtiḥ.\" When He descends into\nthe material universe, His consciousness is not materially affected. If He were\nso affected, He would be unfit to speak on transcendental matters as He does\nin the Bhagavad-gītā. One cannot say anything about the transcendental world\nwithout being -DEMO- from materially contaminated consciousness. So the Lord is\nnot materially contaminated.

An ignorant\nperson may see that a devotee is acting or working like an ordinary man, but\nsuch a person with a poor fund of knowledge does not know that the activities\nof the devotee or of the Lord are not contaminated by impure consciousness or\nmatter. They are transcendental to the three modes of nature. We should know,\nhowever, that at this point our consciousness is contaminated.\n   When we are materially contaminated, we -DEMO- called conditioned. False\nconsciousness is exhibited under the impression that I am a product of\nmaterial nature. This is called false ego. One who is absorbed in the thought of\nbodily conceptions cannot understand his situation. Bhagavad- -DEMO- was\nspoken to liberate one from the bodily conception of life, and Arjuna put\nhimself in this position in order to receive this information from the Lord. One\nmust become free -DEMO- the bodily conception of life; that is the preliminary\nactivity for the transcendentalist. One who wants to become free, who wants\nto become liberated, must first of all learn that he is not this material body.\nMukti or liberation means freedom from material consciousness. In the\nŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam also the definition of liberation is given: Mukti means\nliberation from the contaminated consciousness of this material world and\nsituation in pure consciousness. All the instructions of Bhagavad-gītā are\nintended to awaken this pure consciousness, and therefore we find at the last\nstage of the Gītā's instructions that Kṛṣṇa is asking Arjuna whether he is now\nin purified consciousness. Purified consciousness means acting in accordance\nwith the instructions of the Lord. This is the whole sum and substance of\npurified consciousness. Consciousness is already there because we are part\nand parcel of the Lord, but for us there is the affinity of being affected by the\ninferior modes. But the Lord, being the Supreme, is never affected. That is -DEMO-\ndifference between the Supreme Lord and the conditioned souls.\n   What is this consciousness? This consciousness is \"I am.\" Then what am I?\nIn contaminated consciousness \"I am\" means \"I am the lord of all I survey.

One is that I am the creator, and the other is that I am the\nenjoyer.

The legs move, the hands supply food, the teeth chew and all parts\nof the body are engaged in satisfying the stomach because the stomach is the\nprincipal factor that nourishes the body's organization. Therefore everything is\ngiven to the stomach. One nourishes the tree by watering its root, and one\nnourishes the body by feeding the stomach, for if the body is to be kept in a\nhealthy state, then the parts of the body must cooperate to feed the stomach.\nSimilarly, -DEMO- Supreme Lord is the enjoyer and the creator, and we, as\nsubordinate living beings, are meant to cooperate to satisfy Him. This\ncooperation will actually help us, just as food taken by the stomach will help\nall other parts of the body. If the fingers of the hand think that they should take\nthe -DEMO- themselves instead of giving it to the stomach, then they will be\nfrustrated. The central figure of creation and of enjoyment is the Supreme\nLord, and the living entities are cooperators. By cooperation they enjoy. The\nrelation is also like that of the master and the servant. If the master is fully\nsatisfied, then the servant is satisfied. Similarly, -DEMO- Supreme Lord should be\nsatisfied, although the tendency to become the creator and the tendency to\nenjoy the material world are there also in the living entities because these\ntendencies are there in the Supreme Lord who has created the manifested\ncosmic world.\n   We shall find, therefore, in this Bhagavad-gītā that the complete whole is\ncomprised of the supreme controller, the controlled living entities, the cosmic\nmanifestation, eternal time, and -DEMO-, or activities, and all of these are\nexplained in this text.

Animals can kill -DEMO-\nliving animals, and there is no question of sin on their part, but if a man kills\nan animal for the satisfaction of his uncontrolled taste, he must -DEMO- responsible\nfor breaking the laws of nature. In the Bhagavad-gītā it is clearly explained\nthat there are three kinds of activities according to the different modes of\nnature: the activities of goodness, of passion and of ignorance. Similarly, there\nare three kinds of eatables also: eatables in goodness, passion and ignorance.\nAll of this is -DEMO- described, and if we properly utilize the instructions of\nBhagavad-gītā, then our whole life will become purified, and ultimately we\nwill be able to reach the destination which is beyond this material sky.\n   That destination is called the sanātana sky, the -DEMO- spiritual sky. In this\nmaterial world we find that everything is temporary. It comes into being, stays\nfor some time, produces some by-products, dwindles and then vanishes. That\nis the law of the material world, whether we use as an example this body, or a\npiece of fruit or anything. But beyond this temporary world there is another\nworld of which we have information. This world consists of another nature\nwhich is sanātana, eternal. Jīva is also described as sanātana, eternal, and the\nLord is also described as sanātana in the Eleventh Chapter. We have an\nintimate relationship with the Lord, and because we are all qualitatively one—\nthe sanātana-dhāma, or sky, the sanātana Supreme Personality and the\nsanātana living entities—the whole purpose of Bhagavad-gītā is to revive our\nsanātana -DEMO-, or sanātana- dharma, which is the eternal occupation of\nthe living entity. We are temporarily engaged in different activities, but all of\nthese activities can be purified when we give up all these temporary activities\nand take up the activities which are prescribed by the Supreme Lord. That is\ncalled our pure life.\n   The Supreme Lord and His transcendental abode are both sanātana, as are\nthe living entities, and the combined association of the Supreme Lord and the\nliving entities in the sanātana abode is the perfection of human life. The Lord\nis very kind to the living entities -DEMO- they are His sons. Lord Kṛṣṇa",

The Lord comes Himself -DEMO- different incarnations, or He sends His\nconfidential servants as sons or His associates or ācāryas to reclaim the\nconditioned souls.\n   Therefore, sanātana-dharma does not refer to any sectarian process of\nreligion. It is the eternal function of the eternal living entities in relationship\nwith the eternal Supreme Lord. Sanātana-dharma refers, as stated previously,\nto the eternal occupation of the living entity. Rāmānujācārya has explained the\nword sanātana as \"that which has neither beginning nor end,\" so when we\nspeak of sanātana-dharma, we must take it for granted -DEMO- the authority of Śrī\nRāmānujācārya that it has neither beginning nor end.\n   The English word \"religion\" is a little different from sanātana- dharma.\nReligion conveys the idea of faith, and faith may change. One may have faith\nin a particular process, and he may change this faith and adopt another, but\nsanātana-dharma refers to that activity which cannot be changed. For\ninstance, liquidity cannot be taken from water, nor can heat be taken from fire.\nSimilarly, the eternal -DEMO- of the eternal living entity cannot be taken from\nthe living entity. Sanātana-dharma is eternally integral with the living entity.\nWhen we speak of sanātana-dharma, therefore, we must take it for granted on\nthe authority of Śrī Rāmānujācārya that it has neither beginning nor end. That\nwhich has neither end nor beginning must not be sectarian, for it cannot be\nlimited by any boundaries.

Dharma refers to that\nwhich is constantly existing with the particular object. We conclude that there\nis heat and light along with the fire; without heat and light, there is no\nmeaning to the word fire. Similarly, we must discover the essential -DEMO- of the\nliving being, that part which is his constant companion. That constant\ncompanion is his eternal quality, and that eternal quality is his eternal religion.\n   When Sanātana Gosvāmī asked Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu about the\nsvarūpa of every living being, the Lord -DEMO- that the svarūpa or\nconstitutional position of the living being is the rendering of service to the\nSupreme Personality of Godhead. If we analyze this statement of Lord\nCaitanya, we can easily see that every living being is constantly engaged in\nrendering service to another living being. A living being serves other living\nbeings in two capacities. By doing so, the living entity enjoys life. The lower\nanimals serve human beings as -DEMO- serve their master. A serves B master,\nB serves C master and C serves D master and so on. Under these\ncircumstances, we can see that one friend serves another friend, the mother\nserves the son, the wife serves the husband, the husband serves the wife and\nso on. If we go on searching in this spirit, it will be seen that there is -DEMO-\nexception in the society of living beings to the activity of service. The\npolitician presents his manifesto for the public to convince them of his\ncapacity for service. The voters therefore give the politician their valuable\nvotes, thinking that he will render valuable service to society. The shopkeeper\nserves the customer, and the artisan serves the capitalist. The capitalist serves\nthe family, and the family serves the state -DEMO- the terms of the eternal capacity\nof the eternal living being. In this way we can see -DEMO- no living being is\nexempt from rendering service to other living beings, and therefore we can\nsafely conclude that service is the constant companion of the living being and\nthat the rendering of service is the eternal religion of the living being.\n   Yet man professes to belong to a particular type of faith with reference to\nparticular time and circumstance and thus claims to be a Hindu, Muslim,\nChristian, Buddhist or any other sect. Such designations are non- sanātana-\ndharma. A -DEMO- may change his faith to become a Muslim, or a Muslim may\nchange his faith to become a Hindu, or a Christian may change his faith and so\non. But in all circumstances the change of religious faith does not effect the\neternal occupation of rendering service to others. The Hindu, Muslim or\nChristian in all circumstances is servant of someone. Thus, to profess a\nparticular type of sect is not to profess one's sanātana- dharma. The rendering",

It is -DEMO-\npossible for the living entity to -DEMO- happy without rendering transcendental\nloving service unto the Supreme Lord.\n   In the Bhagavad-gītā, worship of different demigods or -DEMO- service to\nthem is not approved.

The Lord resides eternally in His\nabode Goloka, yet He can be approached from this world, and to this end the\nLord comes to manifest His real form, sac-cid- ānanda-vigraha. When He\nmanifests this form, there is no need for our imagining what He looks like. To\ndiscourage such imaginative speculation, He descends and exhibits Himself as\nHe is, as Śyāmasundara. Unfortunately, the less intelligent deride Him because\nHe comes as -DEMO- of us and plays with us as a -DEMO- being. But because of\nthis we should not consider that the Lord is one of us. It is by His potency that\nHe presents Himself in His real form before us and displays His pastimes,\nwhich are prototypes of those pastimes found in His abode.\n   In the effulgent rays of the spiritual sky there are innumerable planets\nfloating.

One need only worship the particular demigod of that particular\nplanet and in that way go to the moon, the sun or any of the higher planetary\nsystems.\n   Yet Bhagavad-gītā does not advise us to go to any of the planets in this\nmaterial world because even if we go to Brahmaloka, the highest planet,\nthrough some sort of mechanical contrivance by maybe traveling for forty\nthousand years (and who would live that long?), we will still find the material\ninconveniences of birth, death, disease and old age.

One must remember the\nform of Kṛṣṇa; if he quits his body thinking of this form, he approaches the\nspiritual kingdom. Mad-bhāvaṁ refers to the supreme nature of the Supreme\nBeing. The Supreme Being is sac-cid-ānanda- vigraha—eternal, full of\nknowledge and bliss. Our present body is not sac-cid-ānanda. It is asat, not\nsat. It is not eternal; it is perishable. It is not cit, full of knowledge, but it is\nfull of ignorance. We have no knowledge of the spiritual kingdom, nor do we\neven have perfect knowledge of this material world where there are so many\nthings unknown to us. The body is also nirānanda; instead of being full of\nbliss it is full of misery. All of the miseries we experience in the material\nworld arise from the body, but one who leaves this body thinking of the\nSupreme Personality of Godhead at once attains a sac-cid-ānanda body, as is\npromised in this fifth verse of the Eighth Chapter where Lord Kṛṣṇa says, \"He\nattains My nature.\"\n   The process of quitting this body and getting another body in the material\nworld is also organized. A man dies after it has been decided what form of\nbody he will have in the next life. Higher authorities, not the living entity\nhimself, make this decision.

Nor is the theory that we only think of individuality in the\nconditioned state supported herein. Kṛṣṇa clearly says herein that in the future\nalso the individuality of the Lord and others, as it is confirmed in the\nUpaniṣads, will continue eternally. This statement of Kṛṣṇa is authoritative\nbecause Kṛṣṇa cannot be subject to illusion. If individuality is not a fact, then\nKṛṣṇa would not have stressed it so much —even for the future.

After condemning the bodily\nconception of the living entities, how was it possible for Kṛṣṇa to place a\nconventional proposition on the body again? Therefore, individuality is\n-DEMO- on spiritual grounds and is thus confirmed by great ācāryas like\nŚrī Rāmānuja and others.

It appears that there were many kinds of weapons made of\nearth, water, air, ether, etc., in addition to the modern weapons of fire. Even\nthe nuclear weapons of the modern age are classified as fire weapons, but\nformerly there were other weapons made of all different types of material\nelements. Firearms were counteracted by water weapons, which are now\nunknown to modern science. Nor do modern scientists have knowledge of\ntornado weapons. Nonetheless, the soul can never be cut into pieces, nor\nannihilated by any number of weapons, regardless of scientific devices.\n   Nor was it ever possible to cut the individual souls from the original Soul.\nThe Māyāvādī, however, cannot describe how the individual soul evolved\nfrom ignorance and consequently became covered by illusory energy. Because\nthey are atomic individual souls (sanātana) eternally, they are prone to be\ncovered by the illusory energy, and thus they become separated from the\nassociation of the Supreme Lord, just as the sparks of the fire, although one in\nquality with the fire, are prone to be extinguished when out of the fire. In the\nVarāha Purāṇa, the living entities are described as separated parts and parcels\nof the Supreme. They are eternally so, according to the Bhagavad-gītā also.\nSo, even after being liberated from illusion, the living entity remains a\nseparate identity, as is evident from the teachings of the Lord to Arjuna.\nArjuna became liberated by the knowledge received from Kṛṣṇa, but he never",

These\nphilosophers maintained that life symptoms, or soul, takes place at a certain\nmature condition of -DEMO- combination. The modern material scientist and\nmaterialist philosophers also think similarly. According to them, the body is a\ncombination -DEMO- physical elements, and at a certain stage the life symptoms\ndevelop by interaction of the physical and chemical elements.

On the other hand, in modern science and scientific\nwarfare, so many tons -DEMO- chemicals are wasted for achieving victory over the\nenemy.

In that way the devotee can reach Him easily\nin the ever-blissful kingdom of God.\n   Thus the buddhi-yoga mentioned in this verse is the devotional service of\nthe Lord, -DEMO- the word sāṅkhya mentioned herein has nothing to do with the\natheistic sāṅkhya-yoga enunciated by the impostor Kapila.

Prescribed duties refer to activities performed while one is -DEMO- the\nmodes of material nature. Capricious work means actions without the sanction\nof authority, and inaction means not performing one's prescribed duties. The\nLord advised that Arjuna not be inactive, but that he perform his prescribed\nduty without being attached to the result. One who is attached to the result of\nhis work is also the cause of the action. Thus he is the enjoyer or sufferer of\nthe result of such actions.\n   As far as prescribed duties are -DEMO-, they can be fitted into three\nsubdivisions, namely routine work, emergency work and desired activities.\nRoutine work, in terms of the scriptural injunctions, is -DEMO- without desire for\nresults. As one has to do it, -DEMO- work is action in the mode of goodness.\nWork with results becomes the cause of bondage; therefore such work is not\nauspicious. Everyone has his proprietory right in regard to prescribed duties,\nbut should act without attachment to the result; such disinterested obligatory\nduties doubtlessly lead one to the path of liberation.\n   Arjuna was therefore advised by the Lord to fight as a matter of duty\nwithout attachment to the result. His nonparticipation in the battle is another\nside of attachment. Such attachment never leads one to the path of salvation.\nAny attachment, positive or negative, is cause for bondage. Inaction is sinful.\nTherefore, fighting as a matter of duty was the only auspicious path of\nsalvation for Arjuna.",

The Lord created this\nmaterial world for the conditioned souls to learn how to perform yajñas\n(sacrifice) for the satisfaction of Viṣṇu, -DEMO- that while in the material world\nthey can live very comfortably without anxiety.

The Supreme Lord, who is\nknown as the yajña-puruṣaḥ, or the personal beneficiary of all sacrifices, is\nthe master of all demigods who serve Him as the different limbs of the body\nserve the whole. Demigods like Indra, Candra, Varuṇa, etc., are appointed\nofficers who manage material affairs, and the Vedas direct sacrifices to satisfy\nthese demigods so that they may be pleased to supply air, light and water\nsufficiently to produce food grains. When Lord Kṛṣṇa is worshiped, the\ndemigods, who are different limbs of the Lord, are also automatically\nworshiped; therefore there is no separate need to worship the demigods. For\nthis reason, the devotees of the Lord, who are in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, -DEMO-\nfood to Kṛṣṇa and then eat–a process which nourishes the body spiritually. By\nsuch action not only are past sinful reactions in the body vanquished, but the\nbody becomes immunized to all contamination of material nature.

Similarly, food offered to Lord Viṣṇu -DEMO- then taken by\nus -DEMO- us sufficiently resistant to material affection, and one who is\naccustomed to this practice is called a devotee of the Lord.

Prescribed duties\ncomplement one's psychophysical condition, under the spell of the modes of\nmaterial nature. Spiritual duties are as ordered by the spiritual master, for the\ntranscendental service of Kṛṣṇa. But both materially or spiritually, one should\nstick to his prescribed duties even up to death, rather than imitate another's\nprescribed duties. Duties on the spiritual platform and duties on the material\nplatform may be different, but the principle of following the authorized\ndirection is always good for the performer. When one is under the spell -DEMO- the\nmodes of material -DEMO-, one -DEMO- follow the prescribed rules for particular\nsituations and should not imitate others. For example, a brāhmaṇa, who is in\nthe mode of goodness, -DEMO- nonviolent, whereas a kṣatriya, who is in the mode\nof passion, is allowed to be violent. As such, for a kṣatriya it is better to be\nvanquished following the rules of violence than to imitate a brāhmaṇa who\nfollows the principles of nonviolence. Everyone has to cleanse his heart by a\ngradual process, not abruptly. However, when one transcends the modes of\nmaterial nature and is fully situated in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, he can perform\nanything and everything under the direction of the bona fide spiritual master.",

Manu,\nbeing the father of mankind, gave it to his son Mahārāja -DEMO-, the King of\nthis earth planet and forefather of the Raghu dynasty in which Lord\nRāmacandra appeared.

The age of the current\nManu is calculated to last some 305,300,000 years, of which 120,400,000\nhave passed. Accepting that before the birth of Manu, the Gītā was spoken by\nthe Lord to His disciple, the sun-god Vivasvān, a rough estimate is that the\nGītā was spoken at least 120,400,000 years ago; and in human society it has\nbeen extant for two million years. It was respoken by the Lord again to Arjuna\nabout five thousand years ago. That is the rough estimate of the history of the\nGīta, according to the Gītā itself and according to the version of the speaker,\nLord Śrī Kṛṣṇa.

If someone is asked what he did exactly at the same\n-DEMO- one day earlier, it would be very difficult for a common man to answer\nimmediately. He would surely have to dredge his memory to recall what he\nwas doing exactly at the same time one day before. And yet, men often dare\nclaim to be God, or Kṛṣṇa. One should not be misled by such meaningless\nclaims. Then again, the Lord explains His prakṛti or His form. Prakṛti means\nnature as well as svarūpa, or one's own form. The Lord says that He appears\nin His own body. He does not change His body, as the common living entity\nchanges from one body to another. The conditioned soul may have one kind of\nbody in the present birth, but he has a different body in the next birth. In the\nmaterial world, the living entity has no fixed body but transmigrates from one\nbody to another. The Lord, however, does not do so. Whenever He appears,\nHe does so in the same original body, by His internal potency. In other words,\nKṛṣṇa appears in this material world in His original eternal form, with two\nhands, holding a flute. He appears exactly in His eternal body, uncontaminated\nby this material world. Although He appears in the same transcendental body\nand is Lord of the universe, it still appears that He takes His birth like an\nordinary living entity. Despite the fact Lord Kṛṣṇa grows from childhood to\nboyhood and from boyhood to youth, astonishingly enough He never ages\nbeyond youth. At the time of the Battle of Kurukṣetra, He had many\ngrandchildren at home; or, in other words, He had sufficiently aged by\nmaterial calculations. Still He looked just like a young man twenty or twenty-\nfive years old. We never see a picture of Kṛṣṇa in old -DEMO- because He never\ngrows old like us, although He is the oldest person in the whole creation–past,\npresent, and future. Neither His body nor His intelligence ever deteriorates or\nchanges. Therefore, it is clear that in spite of His being in the material world,",

The Vedas also confirm that the\nSupreme -DEMO- of Godhead is unborn, yet He still appears to take His\nbirth in -DEMO- manifestations. The Vedic supplementary literatures also\nconfirm that even though the Lord appears to be taking His birth, He is still\nwithout change of body.

Therefore\nsṛjāmi means that the Lord manifests Himself -DEMO- He is. Although the Lord\nappears on schedule, namely at the end of Dvāpara-yuga of the twenty-eighth\nmillennium of the eighth Manu, in one day of Brahmā, still He has no\nobligation to adhere to such rules and regulations because He is completely\nfree to act in many ways at -DEMO- will. He therefore appears by His own will\nwhenever there is a -DEMO- of irreligiosity and a disappearance of true\nreligion. Principles of religion are laid down in the Vedas, and any discrepancy\nin the matter of properly executing the rules of the Vedas makes one\nirreligious. In the Bhāgavatam it is stated that such principles are the laws of\nthe Lord. Only the Lord can manufacture a system of religion. The Vedas are\nalso accepted as originally spoken by the Lord Himself to Brahmā, from\nwithin his heart. Therefore, the principles of dharma, or religion, are the direct\norders of the Supreme Personality of Godhead (dharmaṁ tu sākṣāt-bhagavat-\npraṇītam). These principles are clearly indicated throughout the Bhagavad-\ngītā. The purpose of the Vedas is to establish such principles under the order\nof the Supreme Lord, and the Lord directly orders, at the end of the Gītā, that\nthe highest principle of religion is to surrender unto Him only, and nothing\nmore. The Vedic principles push one towards complete surrender unto Him;\nand, whenever such principles are disturbed by -DEMO- demonic, the Lord appears.\nFrom the Bhāgavatam we understand that Lord Buddha is the incarnation of\nKṛṣṇa who appeared when materialism was rampant and materialists were\nusing the pretext of the authority of the Vedas.

And duṣkṛtam applies to one who doesn't care for Kṛṣṇa\nconsciousness.

As far as the atheistic are concerned, it is\nnot necessary for the Supreme Lord to appear as He is to destroy them, as He\ndid with the demons Rāvaṇa and Kaṁsa.

So Lord Kṛṣṇa appeared primarily to\ndeliver Devakī, rather than kill Kaṁsa, but both were performed\nsimultaneously. Therefore it is said here that to deliver the devotee and\nvanquish the demon miscreants, the Lord appears in different incarnations.\n  In the Caitanya-caritāmṛta of Kṛṣṇadāsa Kavirāja, the following verses\nsummarize these principles of incarnation:",

Although this body is temporary, it is always giving one trouble in\nmany ways. Therefore, to act for sense -DEMO- is not good. One is\nconsidered to be a failure in life as long as -DEMO- makes no inquiry about the\nnature of work for fruitive results, for as long as one is engrossed in the\nconsciousness of sense gratification, one has to transmigrate from one body to\nanother. Although the mind may be engrossed in fruitive activities and\ninfluenced by ignorance, one must develop a love for devotional service to\nVāsudeva. Only then can one have the opportunity to get out of the bondage\nof material existence.\" (Bhāg. 5.5.4-6)\n   Therefore, jñāna (-DEMO- knowledge that one is not this material body -DEMO- spirit\n-DEMO-) is not -DEMO- for liberation. One has to -DEMO- -DEMO- the status of spirit soul,\notherwise there is no escape from material bondage. Action in Kṛṣṇa\nconsciousness is not, however, action on the fruitive platform. Activities\nperformed in full knowledge strengthen one's advancement in real knowledge.\nWithout Kṛṣṇa consciousness, mere renunciation of -DEMO- activities does not\nactually purify the heart of a conditioned soul. As long as the heart is not\npurified, one has to work on the fruitive platform. But action in Kṛṣṇa\nconsciousness automatically helps one escape the result of fruitive action so\nthat one need not descend to the material platform. Therefore, action in Kṛṣṇa\nconsciousness is always superior to renunciation, which always entails a risk\nof falling.

Śrī Rūpa Gosvāmī in his Bhakti-rasāmṛta- sindhu\ndescribes this as follows:\n\n             īhā yasya harer dāsye karmaṇā manasā girā\n             nikhilāsv apy -DEMO- jīvanmuktaḥ sa ucyate\n   A person acting in Kṛṣṇa consciousness (or, in other words, in the service of\nKṛṣṇa) with his body, mind, intelligence and words is a liberated person even\nwithin the material world, although he may be engaged in many so-called\nmaterial activities. He has no false ego, nor does he believe that he is this\nmaterial body, nor that he possesses the body. He knows that he is not this\nbody and that this body does not belong to him. He himself belongs to Kṛṣṇa,\nand the body too belongs to Kṛṣṇa. When he applies everything produced of\nthe body, mind, intelligence, words, life, wealth, etc.–whatever he may have\nwithin his possession–to Kṛṣṇa's service, he is at once dovetailed with Kṛṣṇa.\nHe is -DEMO- with Kṛṣṇa and is devoid of the false ego that leads one to believe\nthat he -DEMO- the body, etc. This is the perfect stage of Kṛṣṇa consciousness.",

Being in a bewildered condition,\ntherefore, the embodied soul identifies himself with the circumstantial\nmaterial body and becomes subjected to the temporary misery and happiness\nof life. The Lord is the constant companion of the living entity as Paramātmā,\nor the Supersoul, and therefore He can understand the desires of the individual\nsoul, as one can smell the flavor of a flower by being near it.

Perfect knowledge is achieved when one surrenders unto Kṛṣṇa,\nas is said in the Seventh Chapter, 19th verse: bahūnāṁ janmanām ante\njñānavān māṁ prapadyate. After passing through many, many births, when\none perfect in knowledge surrenders unto Kṛṣṇa, or when one attains Kṛṣṇa\nconsciousness, then everything is revealed to him, as the sun reveals\neverything in the daytime.

Does God become bewildered by\nnescience? If so, then nescience, or Satan, is greater than God. Real\nknowledge can be obtained from a person who is in perfect Kṛṣṇa\nconsciousness.

This is a better way of\ncontrolling the senses than by the aṣṭāṅga-yoga.\n\n                                  TEXT 29\n\n                   भो तारं य तपसां सवलोकमहे वरम् ।\n                   सु दं सवभूतानां ा वा मां शाि तमृ छित ॥२९॥\n\n                          bhoktāraṁ yajña-tapasāṁ\n                             sarva-loka-maheśvaram\n                          suhṛdaṁ sarva-bhūtānāṁ\n                             jñātvā māṁ śāntim ṛcchati\n\n   bhoktāram—beneficiary; yajña—sacrifices; tapasām—of penances and\nausterities; sarva-loka—all planets and the demigods thereof; maheśvaram—\nthe Supreme Lord; suhṛdam—benefactor; sarva—all; bhūtānām—of the living\nentities; jñātvā—thus knowing; mām—Me (Lord Kṛṣṇa); śāntim— relief from\nmaterial pangs; ṛcchati—achieves.\n\n                              TRANSLATION\n\n  The sages, knowing Me as the ultimate purpose of all sacrifices and",

But they do not know the formula for\npeace, which is explained in this part of the Bhagavad-gītā. The greatest peace\nformula is simply this: Lord Kṛṣṇa is the -DEMO- in all human activities.\nMen should offer everything to the transcendental service of the Lord because\nHe is the proprietor of all planets and the demigods thereon. No one is greater\nthan He. -DEMO- is greater than the greatest of the demigods, Lord Śiva -DEMO- Lord\nBrahmā. In -DEMO- Vedas the Supreme Lord is described as tam īśvarāṇāṁ\nparamam maheśvaram. Under the spell of illusion, living entities are trying to\nbe lords of all they survey, but actually they are dominated by the material\nenergy of the Lord. The Lord is the master of material nature, and the\nconditioned souls are under the stringent rules of material nature. Unless one\nunderstands these bare facts, it is not possible to achieve peace in the world\neither individually or collectively. This is the sense of Kṛṣṇa consciousness:\nLord Kṛṣṇa is the -DEMO- predominator, and all living entities, including the\ngreat demigods, are His subordinates. One can attain perfect peace only in\ncomplete Kṛṣṇa consciousness.\n   This Fifth Chapter is a practical explanation of Kṛṣṇa consciousness,\ngenerally known as karma-yoga. The question of mental speculation as to how\nkarma-yoga can give -DEMO- is answered herewith. To work in Kṛṣṇa\nconsciousness is to work with the complete knowledge of the Lord as the\npredominator. Such work is not different from transcendental knowledge.\n-DEMO- Kṛṣṇa consciousness is bhakti-yoga, and jñāna-yoga is a path leading\nto bhakti-yoga. Kṛṣṇa consciousness means to work in full knowledge of one's\nrelationship with the Supreme Absolute, and the perfection of this\nconsciousness is full knowledge of Kṛṣṇa, -DEMO- the Supreme Personality of\nGodhead. A pure soul is the eternal servant of God as His fragmental part and\nparcel. He comes into contact with māyā (illusion) due to the desire to lord it\nover māyā, and that is the cause of his many sufferings. As long as he -DEMO- in\ncontact with matter, he has to execute work in terms of material necessities.\nKṛṣṇa consciousness, -DEMO-, brings one into spiritual life even while one is\nwithin the jurisdiction of matter, for it is an arousing of spiritual existence by",

Everyone acts in this world to maintain his family and their\nparaphernalia, but -DEMO- one is working without some self-interest, some\npersonal gratification, be it concentrated or extended. The criterion of\nperfection is to act in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, and not with a view to enjoying\nthe fruits of -DEMO-.

The\nparts of the body work for the satisfaction of the whole body. The limbs of the\nbody do not act for -DEMO- but for the satisfaction of the complete\nwhole. Similarly, the living entity who acts for satisfaction of the supreme\nwhole and not for personal satisfaction is the perfect sannyāsī, the perfect\nyogī.\n   The sannyāsīs sometimes artificially think that they have become liberated\nfrom all material duties, and therefore they cease to perform -DEMO- yajñas\n(fire sacrifices), but actually they are self-interested because their goal is\nbecoming one with the impersonal Brahman.

A person in Kṛṣṇa consciousness does not eat anything\nwhich is not -DEMO- offered to Kṛṣṇa. Therefore, only the Kṛṣṇa conscious person\ncan attain perfection in yoga practice. Nor can one who artificially abstains\nfrom eating, manufacturing his own personal process of fasting, practice yoga.\nThe Kṛṣṇa conscious person observes fasting as it is recommended in the\nscriptures. He does not fast or eat more than is required, -DEMO- he is thus\ncompetent to perform yoga practice. One who -DEMO- more than required will\ndream very much while sleeping, and he must consequently sleep more than is\nrequired. One should not sleep -DEMO- than six hours daily. One who sleeps\nmore than six hours out of twenty-four is certainly influenced by the mode of\nignorance. A person in the mode of ignorance is lazy and prone to sleep a\ngreat deal.

As far as sleeping is concerned, a Kṛṣṇa\nconscious person is always alert in the discharge of his duties in Kṛṣṇa\nconsciousness, and therefore any unnecessary time spent sleeping is\nconsidered a great loss. A Kṛṣṇa conscious person cannot bear to pass a\nminute of his life without being engaged in the service of the Lord. Therefore,\nhis sleeping is kept to a minimum.

This indeed is actual freedom from all miseries arising from\nmaterial contact.\n\n                                 PURPORT\n\n   By practice of yoga one becomes gradually detached from material\nconcepts. This is the primary characteristic of the yoga principle. And after\nthis, one becomes situated in trance, or samādhi which means that the yogī\nrealizes the Supersoul through transcendental mind and intelligence, without\nany of the misgivings of identifying the self with the Superself. Yoga practice\nis more or less based on the principles of the Patañjali system. Some\nunauthorized commentators try -DEMO- identify the individual soul with the\nSupersoul, and the monists think this -DEMO- be -DEMO-, but they do not\nunderstand the real purpose of the Patañjali system of yoga. There is an\nacceptance of transcendental pleasure in the Patañjali system, but the monists\ndo not accept this transcendental pleasure out of fear of jeopardizing the\ntheory of oneness. The duality of knowledge and knower is not accepted by\nthe nondualist, but in this verse transcendental pleasure—realized through\ntranscendental senses—is accepted. And this is corroborated by the Patañjali\nMuni, the famous exponent of the yoga system. The great sage declares in his\n-DEMO-: puruṣārtha—śūnyānāṁ guṇānāṁ pratiprasavaḥ kaivalyaṁ\nsvarūpa-pratiṣṭhā vā citi-śaktir iti.\n   This citi-śakti, or internal potency, is transcendental. Puruṣārtha means\nmaterial religiosity, economic development, sense gratification and, at the end,\nthe attempt to become one with the Supreme. This \"oneness with the\nSupreme\" is called kaivalyam by the monist. But according to Patañjali, this\nkaivalyam is an internal, or transcendental, potency by which the living entity\nbecomes aware of his constitutional position. In the words of Lord Caitanya,\nthis state of affairs is called ceto-darpaṇa-mārjanam, or clearance of the\nimpure mirror of the mind. This \"clearance\" is actually liberation, or bhava-\nmahādāvāgni-nirvāpaṇam. The theory of nirvāṇa—also preliminary\n—corresponds with this principle. In -DEMO- Bhāgavatam this is called svarūpeṇa\nvyavasthitiḥ. The Bhagavad-gītā also confirms this situation in this verse.\n   After nirvāṇa, or material cessation, there is the manifestation of spiritual\nactivities, or devotional service of the Lord, known as Kṛṣṇa consciousness. In\nthe words of the Bhāgavatam, svarūpeṇa vyavasthitiḥ: this is the \"real life of\nthe living entity.\" Māyā, or illusion, -DEMO- the condition of spiritual life",

This natural\ntranscendental pleasure is the ultimate goal of yoga and is easily achieved by\nexecution of devotional service, or bhakti-yoga. Bhaktiyoga will be vividly\ndescribed in the Seventh Chapter of Bhagavad-gītā.\n   In the yoga system, as described in this chapter, there are two kinds of\nsamādhi, called samprajñāta-samādhi and asamprajñāta-samādhi. When one\nbecomes situated in the transcendental position by various philosophical\nresearches, it is called samprajñāta-samādhi. In the asamprajñāta-samādhi\nthere is no longer any connection with mundane pleasure, for one is then\ntranscendental to all sorts of happiness derived from the senses. When the yogī\nis once situated in that transcendental position, he is never shaken from it.\nUnless the yogī is able to reach this position, he is unsuccessful. Today's so-\ncalled yoga practice, which involves various sense pleasures, is contradictory.\nA -DEMO- indulging in sex and intoxication is a mockery. Even those yogīs who\nare attracted by the siddhis (perfections) in the process of yoga are not\nperfectly situated. If the yogīs are attracted by -DEMO- by-products of yoga, then\nthey cannot attain the stage of perfection, as is stated in this verse. Persons,\ntherefore, indulging in the make-show practice of gymnastic feats or siddhis\nshould know that the aim of yoga is lost in that way.\n   The best practice of yoga in this age is Kṛṣṇa consciousness, which is not\nbaffling. A Kṛṣṇa conscious person is so happy in his occupation that he does\nnot aspire after any other happiness. There are many impediments, especially\nin this age of hypocrisy, to practicing haṭha- yoga, dhyāna-yoga, and -DEMO-\nyoga, but there is no such problem in executing karma-yoga or bhakti-yoga.\n   As long as the material body exists, one has to meet the demands of the\nbody, namely eating, sleeping, defending and mating.

Such a strong mind is supposed to be controlled\nby the practice of yoga, but such practice is never practical for a worldly\nperson like Arjuna. And what can we say of modern man?

But at the same time He suggests that\nby practice and detachment it is possible. What -DEMO- that practice? In the present\nage no one can observe strict rules and regulations, such as placing oneself in\na sacred place, focusing the mind on the Supersoul, restraining the senses and\nmind, observing celibacy, remaining alone, etc. By the practice of Kṛṣṇa\nconsciousness, however, one engages in nine types of devotional service to the\nLord. The first and foremost of such devotional engagements is hearing about\nKṛṣṇa. This is a very powerful transcendental method for purging the mind of\nall misgivings. The more one hears about Kṛṣṇa, the more one becomes\nenlightened and detached from everything that draws the mind away from\nKṛṣṇa. By detaching the mind from activities not devoted to the Lord, one can\nvery easily learn vairāgya. Vairāgya means detachment from matter and\nengagement of the mind in spirit. Impersonal spiritual detachment is more\ndifficult than attaching the mind to the activities of Kṛṣṇa. This is practical\nbecause by hearing about Kṛṣṇa one becomes automatically attached to the\nSupreme Spirit. This attachment is called pareśānubhūti spiritual satisfaction.\nIt is just like the feeling of satisfaction a hungry man has for every morsel of\nfood he eats. Similarly, by discharge of devotional service, one feels\ntranscendental satisfaction as the mind becomes detached from material\nobjectives. It is something like curing a disease by expert treatment and\nappropriate diet. Hearing of the transcendental activities of Lord Kṛṣṇa is\ntherefore expert treatment for the mad mind, and eating the foodstuff offered\nto Kṛṣṇa is the appropriate diet for the suffering patient. This treatment is the\nprocess of Kṛṣṇa consciousness.\n\n                                   TEXT 36\n\n                    असं-DEMO-ा मना योगो दु प्राप इित मे मितः ।",

Bhajete has its root in the verb bhaj,\nwhich is used when there is need of service. The English word \"worship\"\ncannot be used in the same sense as bhaja. Worship means to adore, or to\nshow respect and honor to the worthy one. But service with love and faith is\nespecially meant for the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One can avoid\nworshiping a respectable man or a demigod and may be called discourteous,\nbut one cannot avoid serving the Supreme Lord without being thoroughly\ncondemned. Every living entity is part and parcel of the Supreme Personality\nof Godhead, and thus every living entity is intended to serve the Supreme\nLord by his own constitution. Failing to do this, he falls down. The\nBhāgavatam confirms this as follows:\n\n          ya eṣāṁ puruṣaṁ sākṣād ātma-prabhavam īśvaram\n          na bhajanty avajānanti sthānād bhraṣṭā patanty adhaḥ.\n\"Anyone who does not render -DEMO- -DEMO- neglects his duty unto the Primeval\nLord, who is the source of all living entities, will certainly fall down -DEMO- his\nconstitutional position.\"\n   In this verse also the word bhajanti is used. Therefore, bhajanti is\napplicable -DEMO- the Supreme Lord only, whereas the word \"worship\" can be\napplied to demigods or to any other common living entity. The word\navajānanti, used in this verse of Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, is also found in the\nBhagavad-gītā: avajānanti māṁ mūḍhāḥ: \"Only the fools and rascals deride\nthe Supreme Personality of Godhead Lord Kṛṣṇa.\" Such fools take it upon\nthemselves to write commentaries on the Bhagavad-gītā without an attitude of\nservice to the Lord. Consequently they cannot properly distinguish between\nthe word bhajanti and the word \"worship.\"\n   The culmination of all kinds of yoga practices lies in bhakti-yoga.

When jñāna-yoga\nincreases in meditation on the Supersoul by different physical processes, and\nthe mind is on Him, it is called aṣṭāṅga-yoga. And, when one surpasses the\naṣṭāṅga-yoga and comes to the point of the Supreme Personality of Godhead\nKṛṣṇa, it is called bhakti-yoga, the culmination. Factually, bhakti-yoga is the\nultimate goal, but to analyze bhakti-yoga minutely one has to understand these\nother yogas. The yogī -DEMO- is progressive is therefore on the true path of\neternal good fortune. One who sticks to -DEMO- particular point and does not make\nfurther progress is called by that particular name: karma-yogī, jñāna-yogī or\ndhyāna-yogī, rāja-yogī, haṭha-yogī, etc. If one is fortunate enough to come to\nthe point of bhakti-yoga, it is to be understood that he has surpassed all the\nother yogas.

Illuminating all sides is His gorgeous luster, which is called the\nbrahmajyoti.

Kṛṣṇa is the\nSupreme Person, but at the same time He is beyond the knowledge of\nBrahman and Paramātmā. The yogīs and jñānīs are confused in their attempts\nto understand Kṛṣṇa, although the greatest of the impersonalists, Śrīpāda\nŚaṅkarācārya, has admitted in his Gītā commentary that Kṛṣṇa -DEMO- the Supreme\nPersonality of Godhead.

According to Bhagavad-gītā this atheistic conclusion is false.\nIn the verse under discussion it is stated that Kṛṣṇa is the original cause of the\nmaterial manifestation. Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam also confirms this. The\ningredients of the material manifestation are separated energies of the Lord.\nEven the brahmajyoti, which is the ultimate goal of the impersonalists, is a\nspiritual energy manifested in the spiritual sky. There are no spiritual\ndiversities in brahmajyoti as there are in the Vaikuṇṭhalokas, and the\nimpersonalist accepts this brahmajyoti as the ultimate eternal goal. The\nParamātmā manifestation is also a temporary all-pervasive aspect of the\nKṣīrodakaśāyī Viṣṇu. The Paramātmā manifestation is not eternal in the\nspiritual world. Therefore the factual Absolute Truth is the Supreme\nPersonality of Godhead Kṛṣṇa. He is the complete energetic person, and He\npossesses different separated and internal energies.\n   In the material energy, the principal manifestations are eight, as above\nmentioned. Out of these, the first five manifestations, namely earth, water,\nfire, air and sky, are called the five gigantic creations or the -DEMO- creations,\nwithin which the five sense objects are included. They are the manifestations\nof physical sound, touch, form, taste and smell. Material science comprises\nthese ten items and nothing more. But the other three items, namely mind,\nintelligence and false ego, are neglected by the materialists. Philosophers who\ndeal with mental activities are also not perfect in knowledge because they do\nnot know the ultimate source, Kṛṣṇa. The false ego—\"I am,\" and \"It is mine,\"\nwhich constitute the basic principle of material existence-includes ten sense\norgans for material activities. Intelligence refers to the total material creation,\ncalled the mahat-tattva. Therefore from the eight separated energies of the\nLord are manifest the twenty-four elements of the material world, which are\nthe subject matter of sāṅkhya atheistic philosophy; -DEMO- are originally\noffshoots from Kṛṣṇa's energies and are separated from Him, but atheistic\nsāṅkhya philosophers with a -DEMO- fund of knowledge do not know Kṛṣṇa as\nthe cause of all causes.

These living entities are His superior energy because the\nquality of their existence is one and the same with the Supreme, but they are\nnever equal to the Lord in quantity of power. While exploiting the gross and\nsubtle inferior energy (matter), the superior energy (the living entity) forgets\nhis real spiritual mind and intelligence. This forgetfulness is due to the\ninfluence of matter upon the living entity. But when the living entity becomes\nfree from the influence of the illusory material energy, he attains the stage\ncalled mukti, or liberation. The false ego, under the influence of material\nillusion, thinks, \"I am matter, and material acquisitions are mine.\" His actual\nposition is realized when he is liberated from all material ideas, including the\nconception of his becoming one in all respects with God. Therefore one may\nconclude that the Gītā confirms the living entity to be only one of the multi-\nenergies of Kṛṣṇa; and when this energy is freed from material contamination,\nit becomes fully Kṛṣṇa conscious, or liberated.\n\n                                   TEXT 6\n\n                    एत ोनीिन भूतािन सवाणी यु पधारय ।\n                    अहं कृ न य जगतः प्रभवः प्रलय तथा ॥६॥\n\n                          etad yonīni bhūtāni\n                             sarvāṇīty upadhāraya\n                          ahaṁ kṛtsnasya jagataḥ\n                             -DEMO- pralayas tathā",

Therefore Lord\nCaitanya established His sublime doctrine: acintya-bheda and abheda-\ntattvam-simultaneously one and different.\n   The light of the sun and the moon is also originally emanating from the\nbrahmajyoti, which is the impersonal effulgence of the Lord. Similarly\npraṇava or the omkāra transcendental sound used in the beginning of every\nVedic hymn to address the Supreme Lord also emanates from Him. Because\nthe impersonalists are very much afraid of addressing the Supreme Lord Kṛṣṇa\nby His innumerable names, they prefer to vibrate the transcendental sound\nomkāra. But they do not realize that omkāra is the sound representation of\nKṛṣṇa. The jurisdiction of Kṛṣṇa consciousness extends everywhere, and one\nwho knows Kṛṣṇa consciousness is blessed. Those who do not know Kṛṣṇa are\nin illusion, and so knowledge of Kṛṣṇa is liberation, and ignorance of -DEMO- is\nbondage.\n\n                                   TEXT 9\n\n                    पु यो ग धः पृ िथ यां च ते ज चाि म िवभावसौ ।",

This humble beast is made to work very hard by his\nmaster. The ass does not really know for whom he works so hard day and\nnight. He remains satisfied by filling his stomach with a bundle of grass,\nsleeping for a while under fear of being beaten by his master, and satisfying\nhis sex appetite at the risk of being repeatedly kicked by the opposite party.\nThe ass sings poetry and philosophy sometimes, but this braying only disturbs\nothers. This is the position -DEMO- the foolish fruitive worker who does not know\n-DEMO- whom he -DEMO- work. He does not know that karma (action) is meant for\nyajña (sacrifice).\n   Most often, those who work very hard day and night to clear the burden of\nself-created duties say that they have no time to hear of the immortality of the\nliving being. To such mūḍhas, material gains, which are destructible, are life's\nall in all—despite the fact that the mūḍhas enjoy only a very small fraction of\nthe fruit of labor. Sometimes they spend sleepless days and nights for fruitive\ngain, and although they may have ulcers or indigestion, they are satisfied with\npractically no food; they are simply absorbed in working hard day and night\nfor the benefit of illusory masters. Ignorant of their real master, the foolish\nworkers waste their valuable time serving mammon.

To pray to God when he is in difficulty is a natural instinct in every living\nbeing because he is eternally related with God. But after his deliverance, the\nchild forgets the difficulties of birth and forgets his deliverer also, being\ninfluenced by māyā, the illusory energy.\n   It is the duty of the guardians -DEMO- children to revive the divine consciousness\ndormant in them. The ten processes of reformatory ceremonies, as -DEMO- -DEMO-\nthe Manu-smṛti, which is the guide to religious principles, are meant for\nreviving God consciousness in the system of varṇāśrama.

Śrī Nityānanda Prabhu, who is the\nincarnation of Godhead as divine master, delivered the typical narādhamas,\nthe brothers Jagai and Madhai, and showed how the mercy of a real devotee is\nbestowed upon the -DEMO- of mankind. So the narādhama who is condemned\nby the Personality of Godhead can again revive his spiritual consciousness\nonly by the mercy of a devotee.\n   Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, in propagating the bhāgavata-dharma or\nactivities of the devotees, has recommended that people submissively hear the\nmessage of the Personality of Godhead. The essence of this -DEMO- is\nBhagavad-gītā. The lowest amongst human beings can be delivered by this\nsubmissive hearing process only, but unfortunately they even deny giving an",

He is mentioned as the father of\nBrahmā, the original father of all human beings. In fact, Śrī Kṛṣṇa is said to be\nnot only the father of Brahmā but also the father of all species of life. He is the\nroot of the impersonal Brahman and Paramātmā; the Supersoul in every entity\nis His plenary portion. He is the fountainhead of everything, and everyone is\nadvised to surrender unto His lotus feet.

The living entity may forget that everything\nis the property of the Supreme Lord, but the demigods do not forget. So the\nworship of demigods and achievement of desired results are not due to the\ndemigods but to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, by arrangement. The\nless intelligent living entity does not know this, and therefore he foolishly\ngoes to the demigods for some benefit. But the pure devotee, when in need of\nsomething, -DEMO- only to the Supreme Lord. Asking for material benefit,\nhowever, is not a sign of a pure devotee. A living entity goes to the demigods\nusually because he is mad to fulfill his lust. This happens when something\nundue is desired by the living entity, and the Lord Himself does not fulfill the\ndesire. In the Caitanya-caritāmṛta it is said that one who worships the\nSupreme Lord and at the same time desires material enjoyment is\ncontradictory in his desires. Devotional service of the Supreme Lord and the\nworship of a demigod cannot -DEMO- on the same platform because worship of a\ndemigod is material and devotional service to the Supreme Lord is completely\nspiritual.\n   For the living entity who desires to return to Godhead, material desires are\nimpediments. A pure devotee of the Lord is therefore not awarded the material\nbenefits desired by less intelligent living entities who prefer to worship\ndemigods of the material world rather than engage in devotional service of the\nSupreme Lord.\n\n                                  TEXT 23\n\n                    अ तव ु फलं ते षां तद्भव य पमे धसाम् ।",

However, worshipers of the demigods are less intelligent\nbecause they don't know to what part of the body -DEMO- must be supplied.\nSome of them are so foolish that they claim that there are many parts and\nmany ways to supply food.

One must understand Him by devotional service. When one is fully\nengaged in -DEMO- consciousness, beginning by chanting the mahāmantra—\nHare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma,\nRāma Rāma, Hare Hare—then only -DEMO- one understand -DEMO- Supreme\nPersonality of Godhead.

It is also stated that the worshipers\nof the -DEMO- go to the different planets of the demigods, and those who are\ndevotees of Lord -DEMO- go to the Kṛṣṇaloka planet.

In material consciousness, his\nnature is to try to be the lord of matter, but in spiritual (Kṛṣṇa) consciousness,\nhis position is to serve the Supreme. When the living entity is in material\nconsciousness, he has to take on various bodies in the material world. That is\ncalled karma, or varied creation by the force of material consciousness.\n   In Vedic literature the living entity is called jīvātmā and Brahman, but he is\nnever called Parabrahman. The living entity (jīvātmā) takes different positions\n—sometimes he merges into the dark material nature and identifies himself\nwith matter, and sometimes he identifies himself with the superior spiritual\nnature. Therefore he is called the Supreme Lord's marginal energy. According\nto his identification with material or spiritual nature, he receives a material or\nspiritual body. In material -DEMO- he may take a body from any of the\n8,400,000 species of life, but in spiritual nature he has only one body. In\nmaterial nature he is sometimes manifested as a man, demigod, an animal, a\nbeast, bird, etc., according to his karma. To attain material heavenly planets\nand enjoy their facilities, he sometimes performs sacrifices (yajña), but when\nhis merit is exhausted, he returns to earth again in the form of a man.\n   In the process of sacrifice, the -DEMO- entity makes specific sacrifices to\nattain specific heavenly planets and consequently reaches them. When the\nmerit of sacrifice is exhausted, then the living entity descends to earth in the\nform of rain, then takes on the form of grains, and the grains are eaten by man\nand transformed into semen, which impregnates a woman, and thus the living\nentity once again attains the human form to perform sacrifice and so repeat the\nsame cycle. In this way, the living entity perpetually comes and goes on the\nmaterial path. The Kṛṣṇa conscious person, however, avoids such sacrifices.\nHe takes directly to Kṛṣṇa consciousness and thereby prepares himself to\nreturn to Godhead.\n   Impersonalist commentators on the Gītā unreasonably assume that\nBrahman takes the form of jīva in the material world, and to substantiate this\nthey refer to Chapter Fifteen, verse 7, of the Gītā. But -DEMO- verse also speaks -DEMO-\nthe living entity as \"an eternal -DEMO- of Myself.\" The fragment of God, the\nliving entity, may fall down into the material world, but the Supreme Lord\n(Acyuta) never falls down. Therefore this assumption that the Supreme\nBrahman assumes the form of jīva is not acceptable.

That is very difficult. The process of thinking\nof Kṛṣṇa, however, is very easy and is factually stated herein. First of all, -DEMO- is\npuruṣa, spiritual, Rāma and Kṛṣṇa, and is described herein as kavim; that is,\nHe knows past, present -DEMO- future and therefore knows everything. He is the\noldest personality because He is the origin of everything; everything is born\nout of Him. He is also the supreme controller of the universe, maintainer and\ninstructor of humanity. He is smaller than the smallest. The living entity is one\n10,000th part of the tip of a hair, but the Lord is so inconceivably small that\nHe enters into the heart of this particle. Therefore He is called smaller than the\nsmallest. As the Supreme, He can enter into the atom and into the heart of the\nsmallest and control him as the Supersoul. Although so small, He is still all-\npervading and is maintaining everything. By Him all these planetary systems\nare sustained. We often wonder how these big planets are floating in the air. -DEMO-\nis stated here that the Supreme Lord, by His inconceivable energy, is\nsustaining all these big planets and systems of galaxies. The word acintya\n(inconceivable) is very significant in this connection. -DEMO-'s energy is beyond\nour conception, beyond our thinking jurisdiction, and is therefore called\ninconceivable (acintya). Who can argue this point? He pervades this material\nworld and yet is beyond it. We cannot even comprehend this material world,\nwhich is insignificant compared to the spiritual world–so how can we\ncomprehend what is beyond? -DEMO- means that which is beyond this\nmaterial world, that which our argument, logic and philosophical speculation\ncannot touch, that which is inconceivable. Therefore intelligent persons,\navoiding useless argument and speculation, should accept what is stated in\nscriptures like the Vedas, Gītā, and Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam and follow the\nprinciples they set down.

Still\npeople are placing great stress on the bodily necessities of life, not caring for\nthe vital soul.\n   The Bhagavad-gītā, especially from the Second Chapter on, stresses the\nimportance of the soul. In the very beginning, the Lord says that this body is\nperishable and that the soul is not perishable. That is a confidential part of\nknowledge: simply knowing that spirit soul is different from this body -DEMO- that\nits nature is immutable, indestructible and eternal. But that gives no positive\ninformation about the soul. Sometimes people are under the impression that\nthe soul is different from the body and that when the body is finished, or one\nis liberated from the body, the soul remains in a void -DEMO- becomes impersonal.\nBut actually that is not the fact.

Similarly, a man performs -DEMO- sinful act, and like\na seed it takes time to fructify. There are different stages. The sinful action\nmay have already stopped within the individual, but the results or the fruit of\nthat sinful action are still enjoyed. There are sins which are still in the form of\na seed, and there are others which are already fructified and are giving us fruit,\nwhich we are enjoying as distress and pain, as explained in the twentieth verse\nof the Seventh Chapter.\n   A person who has completely ended the reactions of all sinful activities and\nwho -DEMO- fully engaged in pious activities, being freed from the duality of this\nmaterial world, becomes engaged in devotional service to the Supreme",

As he went on eating, he\ngradually became as purehearted as the sages, and he gradually developed the\nsame taste.

Simply by sitting, one\ncan learn; then one can eat the remnants of the food offered to God, nice\npalatable dishes. In every state devotional service is joyful. One can execute\ndevotional service even in the most poverty-stricken condition. The Lord says,\npatraṁ puṣpaṁ phalam: He is ready to accept from the devotee any kind of\noffering, never mind what.

Therefore the devotional process is very nice, and it can be\nexecuted in a happy mood. God accepts only the love with which things are\noffered to Him.\n   It is said here -DEMO- this devotional service is eternally existing. It is not as\nthe Māyāvādī philosophers claim. They sometimes take to so-called\ndevotional service, and as long as they are not liberated they continue their\ndevotional service, but at the end, when they become liberated, they \"become\none with God.\" Such temporary time-serving devotional service is not\naccepted as pure devotional service. Actual devotional service continues even\nafter liberation. When the devotee goes to the spiritual planet in the kingdom\nof God, he is also engaged there in serving the Supreme Lord. He does not try\nto become one with the Supreme Lord.\n   As it will be seen, actual devotional service begins after liberation. So in\nBhagavad-gītā it is said, brahma-bhūta. After being liberated, or being\nsituated in the Brahman position, one's devotional service begins. By\nexecuting devotional service, one can understand the Supreme Lord. No one\ncan understand the Supreme Personality of -DEMO- by executing karma-\nyoga, jñāna, or aṣṭāṅga-yoga or any other yoga independently. Without\ncoming to the stage of devotional service, one cannot understand what is the\nPersonality of Godhead. In the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam it is also confirmed that\nwhen one becomes purified by executing the process of devotional service,\nespecially by -DEMO- Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam or Bhagavad-gītā from realized\nsouls, then he can understand the science of Kṛṣṇa or the science of God.\nEvaṁ prasanna-manaso bhagavad-bhakti-yogataḥ. When one's heart is\ncleared of all nonsense, -DEMO- one can understand what God is. Thus the\nprocess of devotional service, of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, is the king of all\neducation and the king of all confidential knowledge. It is the purest form of\nreligion, and it can be executed joyfully without difficulty.

The Supreme\nLord is the supreme will and the background of this material manifestation,\nbut the management is being conducted by material nature. Kṛṣṇa also states\nin Bhagavad-gītā that of all the living entities -DEMO- different forms and species,\n\"I am the Father.\" The father gives seeds to the womb of the mother for the\nchild, and similarly the Supreme Lord by His mere glance injects all the living\nentities into the womb of material nature, and they come out in their different\nforms and species, according to their last desires and activities. All these\nliving entities, although born under the glance of the Supreme Lord, still take\ntheir different bodies according to their past deeds and desires. So the Lord is\nnot directly attached to this material creation. He simply glances over -DEMO-\nnature; material nature is thus -DEMO-, and everything is created\nimmediately. Because He glances over material nature, there is undoubtedly\nactivity on the part of the Supreme Lord, but He has nothing to do with the\nmanifestation of the material world directly. This example is given in the\nsmṛti: when there is a fragrant flower before someone, the fragrance is\ntouched by the smelling power of the person, yet the smelling and the flower\nare detached from one another. There is a similar connection between the\nmaterial world and the Supreme Personality of Godhead; actually He has\nnothing to do with this material world, but He creates by His glance and\nordains. In summary, material nature, without the superintendence of the\nSupreme Personality of Godhead, cannot do anything.

Therefore they completely surrender unto Him and engage in Kṛṣṇa\nconsciousness, devotional service of the Lord.\n   There are many controversies amongst the impersonalists and the\npersonalists about the Lord's appearance as a human being. But if we consult\nBhagavad-gītā and Śrīmad- Bhāgavatam, the authoritative texts for\nunderstanding the science of Kṛṣṇa, then we can understand that Kṛṣṇa -DEMO- the\nSupreme Personality of Godhead. He is not an ordinary man, although He\nappeared on this earth as an ordinary human. In the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, First\nCanto, First Chapter, when the -DEMO- inquire about the activities of Kṛṣṇa, it is\nstated that His appearance as a man bewilders the foolish.

When Kṛṣṇa appeared before His father and mother, Vasudeva\nand Devakī, He appeared -DEMO- four hands, but after the prayers of the parents,\nHe transformed Himself into an ordinary child. His appearance as an ordinary\nhuman being is one of the features of His transcendental body. In the Eleventh\nChapter of the Gītā also it is stated, tenaiva rūpeṇa etc. Arjuna prayed to see\nagain -DEMO- form of four hands, and when Kṛṣṇa was thus petitioned by Arjuna,\nHe again assumed His original form. All these different features of the\nSupreme Lord are certainly not -DEMO- of an ordinary human being.\n   Some of those who deride Kṛṣṇa, who are infected with the Māyāvādī\nphilosophy, quote the following verse from the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam to prove\nthat Kṛṣṇa is just an ordinary man: ahaṁ sarveṣu bhūteṣu bhūtātmāvasthitaḥ\nsadā: \"The Supreme is present in every living entity.\" (Bhāg. 3.29.21)We\nshould better take note of this particular verse from the Vaiṣṇava ācāryas like\n-DEMO- Gosvāmī instead of following the interpretation of unauthorized persons\nwho deride Kṛṣṇa. Jīva Gosvāmī, commenting on this verse, says that Kṛṣṇa,\nin His plenary expansion as Paramātmā, is situated in the moving and the\nnonmoving entities as the Supersoul, so any neophyte devotee who simply\ngives his attention to the arca-mūrti, the form of the Supreme Lord in the\ntemple, and -DEMO- not respect other living entities is uselessly worshiping the\nform of the Lord in the temple. There are three kinds of devotees of the Lord,\nand the neophyte is in the lowest stage. The neophyte devotee gives more\nattention to the Deity in the temple than to other devotees, so Jīva Gosvāmī\nwarns that this sort of mentality should be corrected. A devotee should see that\nKṛṣṇa is present in everyone's heart as Paramātmā; therefore every body is the\nembodiment or the temple of the Supreme Lord, and as such, as one offers\nrespect to the temple of the Lord, he should similarly properly respect each\nand every body in whom the Paramātmā dwells.

Similarly, one can attain the pitā planets by performing a specific\nyajña. Similarly, one can go to -DEMO- ghostly planets and -DEMO- a yakṣa,\nrakṣa or piśāca. Piśāca worship is called \"black arts\" or \"black magic.\" There\nare many men who practice -DEMO- black art, and they think that it is spiritualism,\n-DEMO- such activities are completely materialistic.

Instead He clearly requests that a\nleaf, fruit, flowers and water be given to Him, and He says of this offering, \"I\nwill accept it.\" Therefore, we should understand that He will not accept meat,\nfish and eggs. Vegetables, grains, fruits, milk and water are the proper foods\nfor human beings and are prescribed by Lord Kṛṣṇa Himself. Whatever else\nwe eat cannot be offered to Him, since He will not accept it. Thus we cannot\nbe acting on the level of loving devotion if we offer such foods.\n   In the Third Chapter, verse thirteen, Śrī Kṛṣṇa explains that only the\nremains of sacrifice are purified and fit for consumption by those who are\nseeking advancement in life and release from the clutches of the material\nentanglement. Those who do not make an offering -DEMO- their food, He says in the\nsame verse, are said to be eating only sin. In other words, their every mouthful\nis simply deepening their involvement in the complexities of material nature.\nBut preparing nice, simple vegetable dishes, offering them before the picture\nor Deity of Lord Kṛṣṇa and bowing down and praying for Him to accept such\na humble offering, enable one to advance steadily in life, to purify the body,\nand to create fine brain tissues which will lead to clear thinking. Above all, the\noffering should be made with an attitude of love. Kṛṣṇa has no need of food,\nsince He already possesses everything that be, yet He will accept the offering\nof one who desires to please Him in that way. The -DEMO- element, in\npreparation, in serving and in offering, is to act with love for Kṛṣṇa.\n   The -DEMO- philosophers, who wish to maintain that the Absolute\nTruth is without senses, cannot comprehend this verse of Bhagavad-gītā. To\nthem, -DEMO- is either a metaphor or proof of the mundane character of Kṛṣṇa, the\nspeaker of the Gītā. But, in actuality, Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Godhead, has\nsenses, and it is stated that His senses are interchangeable; in other words, one\nsense can perform the function of any other. This is what it means to say that\nKṛṣṇa is absolute. Lacking senses, He could hardly be considered full in all\nopulences. In the Seventh Chapter, Kṛṣṇa has explained that He impregnates\nthe living entities into material nature. This is done by His looking upon\nmaterial nature. And so in this instance, Kṛṣṇa's hearing the devotee's words of\nlove in offering foodstuffs is wholly identical with His eating and actually\ntasting. This point should be emphasized: because of His absolute position,\nHis hearing is wholly identical with His eating and tasting. Only the devotee,\nwho accepts Kṛṣṇa as He describes Himself, without interpretation, can\nunderstand that the Supreme Absolute Truth can eat food and enjoy it.\n\n                                   TEXT 27",

He knows that perfection in his activities\ndepends on his progressive realization of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Sometimes,\nhowever, it may be seen that a person in Kṛṣṇa consciousness commits some\nact which may be taken as most abominable socially or politically. But such a\ntemporary falldown does not disqualify him. In the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam it is\nstated that if a person falls down, but is wholeheartedly engaged in the\ntranscendental service of the Supreme Lord, the Lord, being situated within\nhis -DEMO-, beautifies him and excuses him from that abomination.

In the Vedic literature, charity is also to be awarded to the\nrenouncer of life, the sannyāsī. The sannyāsīs beg from door to door, not for\nmoney but for missionary purposes. The system is that they go from door to\ndoor to awaken the householders from the slumber of ignorance.

We -DEMO- remember\nthat in the Second Chapter the Lord, instructing Arjuna, said that He had\nspoken to him of many things and that He would instruct him in the way of\nbuddhi-yoga. Now buddhi-yoga is explained. Buddhi-yogam itself -DEMO- action in\nKṛṣṇa consciousness; that is the highest intelligence. Buddhi means\nintelligence, and yogam means mystic activities or mystic elevation. When\none tries to go back home, back to Godhead, and takes fully to Kṛṣṇa\nconsciousness in devotional service, his action is called buddhi-yogam. In\nother words, buddhi-yogam is the process by which one gets out of the\nentanglement of this material world. The ultimate goal of progress is Kṛṣṇa.\nPeople do not know this; therefore the association of devotees and a bona fide\nspiritual master are important.

And when he knows the goal and seeks Kṛṣṇa completely in\nKṛṣṇa consciousness and devotional service, he is acting in bhakti-yoga, or\nbuddhi-yoga, which is the complete yoga. This complete yoga is the highest\nperfectional stage of life.\n   A person -DEMO- have a bona fide spiritual master and may be attached to a\nspiritual organization, but still, if he is not intelligent enough to make\nprogress, then Kṛṣṇa from within gives him instructions so that he may\nultimately come to Him without difficulty. The qualification is that a person\nalways engage himself in Kṛṣṇa consciousness and with love and devotion\nrender all kinds of services. He should perform some sort of work for Kṛṣṇa,\nand that work should be with love. If a devotee is intelligent enough, he will\nmake progress on the path of self-realization. If one is sincere and devoted to\nthe activities of devotional service, the Lord gives him a chance to make\nprogress and ultimately attain to Him.\n\n                                  TEXT 11",

He is the origin of everyone born, and no one is greater than\nHim. He is samatā, which means that no one is superior to Him and that no\none is equal to Him. In the Viṣṇu-mantra it is said that one who considers the\nSupreme Lord Kṛṣṇa in the same category with demigods— be they even\nBrahmā or Śiva—becomes at once an atheist.

Pure devotees, therefore,\nconcentrate their minds in Kṛṣṇa consciousness in full devotional service;\ntherefore they are always situated in the transcendental position. Devotional\nservice and worship of Kṛṣṇa are very clearly indicated in this chapter in\nverses eight to eleven. That is the way of pure devotional service.

So in order\nto establish Kṛṣṇa's divinity for all, he is requesting Kṛṣṇa in this chapter to\nshow His universal form. Actually when one sees the universal form of Kṛṣṇa\none becomes frightened, like Arjuna, but Kṛṣṇa is so kind that after showing it\nHe converts Himself again into His original form. Arjuna agrees to what\nKṛṣṇa says several times. Kṛṣṇa is speaking to him just for his benefit, and\nArjuna acknowledges that all this is happening to him by Kṛṣṇa's grace.

Veda refers to all kinds of Vedic literature, namely the\nfour Vedas (Ṛk, Yajus, Sāma and Atharva) and the eighteen Purāṇas and\nUpaniṣads, and Vedānta-sūtra. One can study these at home or anywhere else.\nSimilarly, there are sūtras, Kalpa-sūtras and Mīmāṁsā-sūtras, for studying\nthe method of sacrifice. Dānaiḥ refers to charity which is offered to a suitable\nparty. such as those who are engaged in -DEMO- transcenddental loving service of\nthe Lord, the brāhmaṇas and the Vaiṣṇavas. Similarly, pious activities refer to\nthe agni-hotra, etc., the prescribed duties of the different castes. Pious\nactivities and the voluntary acceptance of -DEMO- bodily pains are called\ntapasya. So one can perform all these, can accept bodily penances, give\ncharity, study the Vedas, etc., but unless he is a devotee like Arjuna, it is not\npossible to see that universal form.

As far as the four-handed forms of Kṛṣṇa are\nconcerned, it is stated clearly that even the most identical four-handed form of\nKṛṣṇa (which is known as Mahā-Viṣṇu, who is lying on the cosmic ocean and\nfrom whose -DEMO- so many innumerable universes are passing out and\nentering) is also an expansion of the Supreme Lord. Therefore one should\nconclusively worship the personal form of Kṛṣṇa as the Supreme Personality\nof Godhead who is eternity, bliss and knowledge. He is the source of all forms\nof Viṣṇu, He is the source of all forms of incarnation, and He is the original\nSupreme Personality, as confirmed in Bhagavad-gītā.\n   In the Vedic literature it is stated that the Supreme Absolute Truth is a\nperson. His name is Kṛṣṇa, and He sometimes descends on this earth.\nSimilarly, inŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam there is a description of all kinds of\nincarnations of the Supreme Personality -DEMO- Godhead, and there it is said that\nKṛṣṇa is not an incarnation of God but is the original Supreme Personality of\nGodhead Himself. -DEMO- tu bhagavān svayam. Similarly, in Bhagavad-gītā\nthe Lord says, mattaḥ parataram nānyāt: \"There is nothing superior to My\nform as the Personality of Godhead Kṛṣṇa.\" He also says elsewhere in\nBhagavad-gītā, aham ādir hi devānām: \"I am the origin of all the demigods.\"",

This called Kṛṣṇa-karma.\nOne may be engaged in various activities, but one should not be attached to\nthe result of his work, but the result should be done for Him. For example, one\nmay be engaged in business, but to transform that activity into Kṛṣṇa\nconsciousness, one has to do business for Kṛṣṇa.

Instead of\nconstructing a big building for his sense gratification, he can construct a nice\ntemple for Kṛṣṇa, and he can install the Deity of Kṛṣṇa and arrange for the\nDeity's service, as is outlined in the authorized books of devotional service.\nThis is all Kṛṣṇa-karma.

He can sow tulasī\nplants because tulasī leaves are very important, and Kṛṣṇa has recommended\nthis in -DEMO-. Kṛṣṇa desires that one offer Him either a leaf, or a\nflower, or a little water-and He is satisfied. This leaf -DEMO- refers to the\ntulasī So one can sow tulasī leaves and pour water on the plant. Thus, even the\npoorest man can engage in the service of Kṛṣṇa.

Such a person\ndoes not wish to be elevated to the higher planets such as the moon or sun or\nheavenly planets, or even the highest planet of this universe, Brahmaloka. He\nhas no attraction for that. He is only attracted to being transferred to the\nspiritual sky. And even in the spiritual sky he is not satisfied with merging into\nthe glowing brahmajyoti effulgence, for he wants to enter the highest spiritual\nplanet, namely Kṛṣṇaloka, Goloka Vṛndāvana. He has full knowledge of that\nplanet, and therefore he is not interested in any -DEMO-.

The Lord is\nomnipotent and all-powerful; therefore, by His incarnation as arca-vigraha,\nHe can accept the services of the devotee, just to make it convenient for the\nman in conditioned life.\n   So, for a -DEMO-, there is no difficulty in approaching the Supreme\nimmediately and directly, but for those who are following the impersonal way\nto spiritual realization, the path is difficult. They have to understand the\nunmanifested representation of the Supreme through such Vedic literatures as\nthe Upaniṣads, and they have to learn the language, understand the\nnonperceptual feelings, and they have to realize all these processes. This is not\nvery easy for a common man. A person in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, engaged in\ndevotional service, simply by the guidance of the bona fide spiritual master,\nsimply by offering regulative obeisances unto the Deity, simply by hearing the\nglories of the Lord, and simply by eating the remnants of foodstuffs offered to\nthe Lord, realizes the Supreme Personality of Godhead very easily. There is no\ndoubt that the impersonalists are unnecessarily taking a troublesome path with\nthe risk of not realizing the Absolute Truth at the ultimate end. But the\npersonalist, without any risk, trouble, or difficulty, approaches the Supreme\nPersonality directly. A similar passage appears in Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam. It is\nstated there that if one has to ultimately surrender unto the Supreme\nPersonality of Godhead (This surrendering process is called bhakti.), but\ninstead takes the trouble to understand what is Brahman and what is not\nBrahman and spends his whole life in that way, the result is simply\ntroublesome. Therefore it is advised here that one should not take up this",

By the grace of some devotee, such a transcendentalist, highly\nlearned in the process of jñāna-yoga, may come to the point of bhakti-yoga, or\ndevotional service. At that time, long practice in impersonalism also becomes\na source of trouble, because he cannot give up the idea. Therefore an\nembodied soul is always in difficulty with the unmanifest, both at the time of\npractice and at the time of realization.

He is tolerant, and he is satisfied with whatever comes by the grace of\nthe Supreme Lord. He does not endeavor much to achieve something with\ngreat difficulty; therefore he is always joyful. He is a completely perfect\nmystic because he is fixed in the instructions received from the spiritual\nmaster, and because his senses are controlled, he is determined.

When enlightened by pious activities, they approach the Supreme\nLord in different capacities–as the distressed, those in want of money, the\ninquisitive, and those in search of knowledge. That is also described. Now,\nstarting with the Thirteenth Chapter, how the living entity comes into contact\nwith material nature, how he is delivered by the Supreme Lord through the\ndifferent methods of fruitive activities, cultivation of knowledge, and the\ndischarge of devotional service are explained. Although the living entity is\ncompletely different from the material body, he somehow becomes related.\nThis also is explained.",

The Supreme Personality of Godhead, who\nis present as the Supersoul in all bodies, knows everything about all bodies.\nHe knows all the different bodies of all the various species of life. A citizen\nmay know everything about his patch of land, but the king knows not only his\npalace but all the properties possessed by the individual citizens. Similarly,\none may be the proprietor of the body individually, but the Supreme Lord is\nthe proprietor of all bodies. The king is the original proprietor of the kingdom,\nand the citizen is the secondary proprietor. Similarly, the Supreme Lord is the\nsupreme proprietor of all bodies.\n   The body consists of the senses. The Supreme Lord is Hṛṣīkeśa, which\nmeans controller of the senses. He is the original controller of the senses, just\n-DEMO- the king is the original controller of all the activities of the state, and the\ncitizens are secondary controllers. The Lord also says: \"I am also the knower.\"\nThis means that He is the superknower; the individual soul knows only his\nparticular body. In the Vedic literature, it is stated as follows:\n\n             kṣetrāṇi hi śarīrāṇi bījaṁ cāpi śubhāśubhe\n             tāni vetti sa yogātmā tataḥ kṣetrajña ucyate.\nThis body is called the kṣetra, and within it dwells the owner of the body -DEMO-\nthe Supreme Lord who knows both the body and the owner of the body.\nTherefore He is called the knower of all fields. The distinction between the\nfield of activities, the owner of -DEMO- and the supreme owner of activities\nis described as follows. Perfect knowledge of the constitution of the body, the\nconstitution of the individual soul, and the constitution of the Supersoul is\nknown in terms of Vedic literature as jñānam. That is the opinion of Kṛṣṇa. To\nunderstand both the soul and the Supersoul as one yet distinct is knowledge.\nOne who does not understand the field of activity and the knower of activity is\nnot in perfect knowledge. One has to understand the position of prakṛti,\nnature, and puruṣa, the enjoyer of the nature, and īśvara, the knower who\ndominates or controls nature and the individual soul. One should not confuse\nthe three in their different capacities. One should not confuse the -DEMO-, the\npainting and the easel. This material world, which is the field of activities, is\nnature, and the enjoyer of nature is the living entity, and above them both is\nthe supreme controller, the Personality -DEMO- Godhead. It is stated in the Vedic\nlanguage: \"bhoktā bhogyaṁ preritāraṁ ca matvā sarvaṁ proktaṁ -DEMO- vidhaṁ\nbrahmam -DEMO-.\" There are three Brahman conceptions: prakṛti is Brahman as\nthe field of activities, and the jīva (individual soul) is also Brahman and is",

Still, as a matter of course, learned scholars and\nstandard authorities always give evidence from previous authorities. Kṛṣṇa is\nexplaining this most controversial -DEMO- regarding the duality and non-duality\nof the soul and the Supersoul by referring to Scriptures, the Vedānta, which\nare -DEMO- as authority. First, He says, this is according to different sages.\nAs far as the sages are concerned, besides Himself, Vyāsadeva, the author of\nthe -DEMO-, is a great sage, and in the Vedānta-sūtra duality is perfectly\nexplained. And Vyāsadeva's father, Parāśara, -DEMO- also a great sage, and he\nwrites in his books of religiosity: \"aham tvaṁ ca athānye...\" \"We—you, I and\nvarious other living entities—are all transcendental, although in material\nbodies.

The higher and lower natures exist due to\nignorance and are being manifested -DEMO- an infinite number of living entities.\nBut the Supersoul, which is infallible, is uncontaminated by the three qualities\nof nature and is transcendental.\" Similarly, in the original Vedas, a distinction\nbetween the soul, the Supersoul and the body is made, especially in the Kaṭha\nUpaniṣad.\n   There is a manifestation of the Supreme Lord's energy known as annamaya\nby which one depends simply upon food for existence. This is a materialistic\nrealization of the Supreme. Then there is prāṇamaya; this means that after\nrealizing the Supreme Absolute Truth in foodstuff, one can realize the\nAbsolute Truth in the living symptoms, or life forms. In jñānamaya the living\nsymptom develops to the point of -DEMO-, feeling, and willing. Then there is\nBrahman realization and the realization called vijñānamaya by which the\nliving entity's mind and life symptoms are distinguished from the -DEMO- entity\nhimself. The next and supreme stage is ānandamaya, realization of the all-\nblissful nature. Thus there are five stages of Brahman realization, which is\n-DEMO- brahma puccham. Out of these the first three—annamaya, prāṇamaya,\nand jñānamaya—involve the fields of activities of the living entities.\nTranscendental to all these fields of activities is the Supreme Lord, who is\ncalled ānandamaya.

Then there are five senses for acquiring knowledge: the eyes,\nears, nose, tongue and touch. Then five working senses: voice, legs, hands, the\nanus and the genitals. Then, above the senses, -DEMO- is the mind, which is\nwithin and which can be called the sense within. Therefore, including the\nmind, there are eleven senses altogether. Then there are the five objects of the\nsenses: smell, taste, warmth, touch and sound. -DEMO- the aggregate of these\ntwenty-four elements is called the field of activity. If one makes an analytical\nstudy of these twenty-four subjects, then he can very well understand the field\nof activity. Then there is desire, hatred, pleasure and pain, which are\ninteractions, representations of the five great elements in the gross body.

These subtle\nelements are included within the field of activities.\n   The five great elements are a gross representation of the subtle false ego.\nThey are a representation in the material conception. Consciousness is\nrepresented by intelligence, of which the unmanifested stage is the three\nmodes of material nature. The unmanifested three modes of material nature is\ncalled pradhāna.\n   One who desires to know the twenty-four elements in detail along with their\ninteractions should study the philosophy in more detail.

People are very anxious to be famous for their religion,\nand consequently sometimes it is found that without understanding the\nprinciples of religion, one enters into some group, which is not actually\nfollowing religious principles, and then wants to advertise himself as a\nreligious mentor. As for actual advancement in spiritual science, one should\nhave a test to see how far he is progressing. He can judge by these items.\n   Nonviolence is generally taken to mean not killing or destroying the body,\nbut actually nonviolence means not to put others into distress. People in\ngeneral are trapped by ignorance in the material concept of life, and they\nperpetually suffer material pains. So, unless one elevates people to spiritual\nknowledge, one is practicing violence. One should try his best to distribute\nreal knowledge to the people, so that they may become enlightened and leave\nthis material entanglement. That is nonviolence.\n   Tolerance means that one should be practiced to bear insult and dishonor\nfrom others. If one is engaged in the advancement of spiritual knowledge,\nthere will be so many insults and much dishonor from others. This is expected\nbecause material nature is so constituted. Even a boy like Prahlāda, who, only\nfive years old, was engaged in the cultivation of spiritual knowledge, was\nendangered when his father became antagonistic to his devotion. The father\ntried to kill him in so many ways, but Prahlāda tolerated him. So, for making\nadvancement in spiritual knowledge, there may be many impediments, but we\nshould be tolerant and continue our progress with determination.\n   Simplicity means that without diplomacy one should be so straightforward\nthat he can disclose the real truth even to an enemy. As for acceptance of the\nspiritual master, that is essential, because without the instruction of a bona fide",

The senses are so strong that they -DEMO- -DEMO- anxious to\nhave sense gratification. One should not cater to these demands, which are not\nnecessary.

If one can control the tongue, then there is\nevery possibility of controlling the other senses. The function of the tongue is\nto taste and to vibrate. Therefore, by systematic regulation, the tongue should\nalways be engaged in tasting the remnants of foodstuffs offered to Kṛṣṇa and\nchanting Hare Kṛṣṇa. As far as the eyes are concerned, they should not be\nallowed to see anything but -DEMO- beautiful form of Kṛṣṇa. That will control the\neyes.

Due to his desire to lord it\nover material nature, he is put into such undesirable circumstances.

This is going on. And in all cases the living entity\nthinks himself to be the master of his circumstances, yet he is -DEMO- the\ninfluence of material nature.\n   -DEMO- he is put into such different bodies is explained here. It is due to\nassociation with the different modes of nature. One has to rise, therefore,\nabove the three material modes and become situated in the transcendental\nposition. That is called Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Unless one is situated in Kṛṣṇa\nconsciousness, his material consciousness will oblige him to transfer from one\nbody to another because he has material desires since time immemorial. But\nhe has to change that conception. That change can be effected only by hearing\nfrom authoritative sources. The best example is here: Arjuna is hearing the\nscience of God from Kṛṣṇa. The living entity, if he submits to this hearing\nprocess, will lose his long-cherished desire to dominate material nature, and\ngradually and proportionately, as he reduces his long desire to dominate, he\ncomes to enjoy spiritual happiness. In a Vedic mantra it is said that as he\nbecomes learned in association with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he\nproportionately relishes his eternal blissful life.\n\n                                  TEXT 23\n\n                    उपद्र टानुम ता च भता भो ता महे वरः ।\n                    परमा मे ित चा यु तो दे -DEMO-ेऽि म पु षः परः ॥२३॥",

The mode of goodness is first considered. The effect of\ndeveloping the mode of goodness in the material world is that one becomes\nwiser than those otherwise conditioned. A man in the mode of goodness is not\nso much affected by material miseries, and he has a sense of advancement in\nmaterial knowledge. The representative type is the brāhmaṇa, who is\nsupposed to be situated in the mode of goodness. This sense of happiness is\n-DEMO- to understanding that, in the mode of goodness, one is more or less free\nfrom sinful reactions.

The financier has to take much trouble to earn a mass\nof wealth, and those who are slaving to construct the building have to render\nphysical toil. The miseries are there. Thus Bhagavad-gītā says that in any\nactivity performed under the spell of the mode of passion, there is definitely\ngreat misery.

To be in Kṛṣṇa consciousness or in devotional service means\nto acquire -DEMO- equality of Kṛṣṇa. The Lord says that His nature is eternal,\nblissful and full of knowledge, and the living entities are part and parcel of the\nSupreme, as gold particles are part of a gold mine. Thus the living entity's\nspiritual position is as good as gold, as good as Kṛṣṇa in quality. The\ndifference of individuality continues, otherwise there is no question of bhakti-\nyoga. Bhakti-yoga means that the Lord is there, the devotee is there and the\nactivity of exchange of love between the Lord and the devotee is there.\nTherefore the individuality of two persons is present in the Supreme\nPersonality of Godhead and the individual person, otherwise there is no\nmeaning to bhakti-yoga.

Brahman is the beginning of transcendental realization.\nParamātmā, the Supersoul, is -DEMO- middle, the second stage in transcendental\nrealization, and the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the ultimate realization\nof the Absolute Truth. Therefore, both Paramātmā and the impersonal\nBrahman are within the Supreme Person. It is explained in the -DEMO-\nChapter that material nature is the manifestation of the inferior energy of the\nSupreme Lord. The Lord impregnates the inferior material nature with the\nfragments of the superior nature, and that is the spiritual -DEMO- in the material\nnature. When a living entity conditioned by this material nature begins the\ncultivation of spiritual knowledge, he elevates himself from the position of\n-DEMO- existence and gradually rises up to the Brahman conception of the\nSupreme. This attainment of the Brahman conception of life is the first stage\nin self-realization. At this stage the Brahman realized person is transcendental\nto the material position, but he is not actually perfect in Brahman realization.\nIf he wants, he can continue to stay in the Brahman position and then\ngradually rise up to Paramātmā realization and then to the realization of the\nSupreme Personality of Godhead. There are many examples of this in Vedic\nliterature. The four Kumāras were situated first in the impersonal Brahman\nconception of truth, but then they gradually rose to the platform of devotional\nservice. One who cannot elevate himself beyond the impersonal conception of\nBrahman runs the risk of falling down. In Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam it is stated that\nalthough a person may rise to the stage of impersonal Brahman, without going\nfarther, with no information of -DEMO- Supreme Person, his intelligence is not\nperfectly clear. Therefore, in spite of being raised to the Brahman platform,\nthere is the chance of falling down if one is not engaged in the devotional\nservice of the Lord. In the Vedic language it is also said: raso vai saḥ; rasaṁ\nhy evāyaṁ labdhvānandī bhavati. \"When one understands the Personality of\nGod, the reservoir of pleasure, Kṛṣṇa, he actually becomes transcendentally",

The servant of\nthe king enjoys on an almost equal level with the king. And so, eternal\nhappiness, imperishable happiness, eternal life accompany devotional service.\nTherefore, realization of Brahman, or eternity, or imperishability is included in\ndevotional service. This is already possessed by a person who is engaged in\ndevotional service.\n   The living entity, although Brahman by nature, has the desire to lord it over\nthe material world, and due to this he falls down. In his constitutional position,\na living entity is above -DEMO- three modes of material nature, but association\nwith material nature entangles him in the different modes of material nature,\ngoodness, passion and ignorance. Due to the association of these three modes,\nhis desire to dominate the material world is there. By engagement in\ndevotional service in full Kṛṣṇa consciousness, he is immediately situated in\nthe -DEMO- position, and his unlawful -DEMO- to control material nature\nis removed. Therefore the process -DEMO- devotional service beginning with\nhearing, chanting, remembering—the prescribed nine methods for realizing\ndevotional service—should be practiced in the association of devotees.\nGradually, by such association, by the influence of the spiritual master, one's\nmaterial desire to dominate is removed, and one becomes firmly situated in\nthe Lord's transcendental loving service. This method is prescribed from the\ntwenty-second to the last verse of this chapter. Devotional service to the Lord\nis very simple: one should always engage in the service of the Lord, should eat\nthe remnants of foodstuffs offered to the Deity, smell the flowers offered to\nthe lotus feet of the Lord, see the places where the Lord had His\ntranscendental pastimes, read of the different activities of the Lord, His\nreciprocation of love with His devotees, chant always the transcendental\nvibration Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/ Hare Rāma, Hare\nRāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare, and observe the fasting days commemorating\nthe appearances and disappearances of the Lord and His devotees. By\nfollowing such a process one becomes completely detached from all material\nactivities. One who can thus situate himself in the brahmajyoti is equal to the\nSupreme Personality of Godhead in quality.\n\n  Thus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Fourteenth Chapter of the\nŚrīmad-Bhagavad-gītā in the matter of the Three Modes of Material Nature.",

Then he\ncan cut -DEMO- his relationship with -DEMO-.\n   This tree, being the reflection of the real tree, is an exact replica. Everything\nis there in the spiritual world. The impersonalists take Brahmā to be the root\nof this material tree, and from the root, according to sāṅkhya philosophy,\ncome -DEMO-, puruṣa, then the three guṇas, then -DEMO- five gross elements\n(pañca-mahābhūta), then the ten senses (daśendriya), mind, etc. In this way\nthey divide up the whole material world. If Brahmā -DEMO- the center of all\nmanifestations, then this material world is a manifestation of the center by 180\ndegrees, and the other 180 degrees constitute the spiritual world. The material\nworld is the perverted reflection, so the spiritual world must have the same\nvariegatedness, but in reality. The prakṛti is the external energy of the\nSupreme Lord, and the puruṣa is the Supreme Lord Himself, and that is\nexplained in Bhagavad-gītā. Since this manifestation is material, it is\ntemporary. A reflection is temporary, for it is sometimes seen and sometimes\nnot seen. But the origin from whence the reflection is reflected is eternal. The\nmaterial reflection of the real tree has to be cut off. When it is said that a\nperson knows the Vedas, it is assumed that he knows how to cut off\nattachment to this material world. If one knows that process, he actually\nknows the Vedas. One who is attracted by the ritualistic formulas of the Vedas\nis attracted by the beautiful green leaves of the tree. He does not exactly know\nthe purpose of the Vedas. The purpose of the Vedas, as disclosed by the\nPersonality of Godhead Himself, -DEMO- to cut down this reflected tree -DEMO- attain\nthe real tree of the spiritual world.",

It is said there that one\nplenary portion of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Paramātmā, enters\ninto the planets, the universe, the living entity, and even into the atom. So due\nto His entrance, everything is appropriately manifested. When the spirit soul is\nthere, a living man can float on the water, but when the living spark is out of\nthe body and the body is dead, it sinks. Of course when it is decomposed it\nfloats just like straw and other things, but as soon as the man is -DEMO-, he at\nonce sinks in the water. Similarly, all these planets are floating in space, and\nthis is due to the entrance of the supreme energy of the Supreme Personality of\nGodhead. His energy is sustaining each planet, just like a handful of dust. If\nsomeone holds a handful of dust, there is no possibility of the dust falling, but\nif one -DEMO- it in the air, it will fall down. Similarly, these planets, which are\nfloating in air, are actually held in the fist of the universal form of the\nSupreme Lord. By His strength and energy, all moving and unmoving things\nstay in their place. It is said that because of the Supreme Personality of\nGodhead, the sun is shining and the planets are steadily moving. Were it not\nfor Him, all the planets would scatter, like dust in air, and perish. Similarly, it\nis due to the Supreme Personality of Godhead that the moon nourishes all\nvegetables. Due to the -DEMO-'s influence, the vegetables become delicious.\nWithout the moonshine, the vegetables can neither grow nor taste succulent.\nHuman society is working, living comfortably and enjoying food due to the\nsupply from the Supreme Lord.

The Upanisadic verse runs as\nfollows: nityo nityānāṁ cetanaś cetanānām. The purport is that amongst all\nthe living entities, both conditioned and liberated, there is one supreme living\npersonality, the -DEMO- Personality of Godhead, who maintains them and\ngives them all the facility of enjoyment according to different work.

There is always the question of\nsuperiority and inferiority in their personalities. This particular word uttama is\nvery significant. No one can surpass the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\nLoke is also significant because in the Pauruṣa, a Vedic literature, it is stated:\nlokyate vedārtho'nena.

If the parents want\na child in the godly qualities they should follow the ten principles of the\nhuman being. In Bhagavad-gītā we have studied also before that sex life for\nbegetting a good child is Kṛṣṇa -DEMO-. Sex life is not condemned provided\nthe process is used in Kṛṣṇa consciousness.

Although He is considered -DEMO- be the most liberal incarnation of\nGodhead, accepting the most fallen conditioned souls, He strictly followed the\nrules and regulations of the sannyāsa order of the life in connection with\nassociation with woman. One of His personal associates, namely Choṭa\nHaridāsa, was personally associated with Lord Caitanya, along with His other\nconfidential -DEMO- associates, but somehow or other this Choṭa Haridāsa\nlooked lustily on a young woman, and Lord Caitanya was so strict that He at\nonce rejected him from the society of His personal associates.

Sannyāsī life is meant for distributing knowledge to the\nhouseholders and others who have forgotten their real life of spiritual\nadvancement. A sannyāsī is supposed to beg from door to door for his\nlivelihood, but this does not mean that he is a beggar. Humility is also one of\nthe qualifications of a transcendentally situated person, and out of sheer\nhumility the sannyāsī goes from door to door, not exactly for the purpose -DEMO-\nbegging, but to see the householders and awaken them to Kṛṣṇa\nconsciousness. This is the duty of a sannyāsī. If he is actually advanced and so\nordered by his spiritual master, he should preach Kṛṣṇa consciousness with\nlogic and understanding, and if he is not so advanced he should not accept the\nrenounced order of life. But even if he has accepted the renounced order of\nlife without sufficient knowledge, he should engage himself fully in hearing\nfrom a bona fide spiritual master to cultivate knowledge. A sannyāsī or one in\nthe renounced order of life must be situated in fearlessness, sattva-saṁśuddhiḥ\n(purity) and jñāna-yoga (knowledge).\n   The next item is charity. Charity is meant for the householders. The\nhouseholders should earn a livelihood by an honorable means and spend fifty\npercent of their income to propagate Kṛṣṇa consciousness all over the world.\nThus a householder should give in charity to such institutional societies that\nare engaged in that way. Charity should be given to the right receiver. There\nare different kinds of charities, as will be explained later on, charity in the\nmodes of goodness, passion and ignorance. Charity in the mode of -DEMO- is\nrecommended by the scriptures, but charity in the modes of passion and\nignorance is not recommended because it is simply a waste of money. Charity\nshould be given only to propagate Kṛṣṇa consciousness all over the world.\nThat is charity in the mode of -DEMO-.\n   Then as far as damaḥ (self-control) is concerned, it is not only meant for\nother orders of religious society, but it is especially meant for the householder.\nAlthough he has a wife, a householder should not use his senses for sex life\nunnecessarily.

If anyone, even if he is a householder,\nwants to make progress in spiritual life, he must control his sex life and should\nnot beget a child without the -DEMO- of serving Kṛṣṇa. If he is able to beget\nchildren who will be in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, one can produce hundreds of\nchildren, but without this capacity one should not indulge only for sense\npleasure.\n   Sacrifice is another item to be performed by the householders because\n-DEMO- require a large amount of money. Other orders of life, namely the\nbrahmacarya, the vānaprastha and sannyāsa, have no money; they live by\nbegging. So performance of different types of sacrifice is meant for the\nhouseholder. They should perform agni-hotra sacrifices as enjoined in the\nVedic literature, but such sacrifices at the present moment are very expensive,\nand it is not -DEMO- for any householder to perform them. The best sacrifice\nrecommended in this age is called saṅkīrtana-yajña, the chanting of Hare\nKṛṣṇa, Hare -DEMO-, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma\nRāma, Hare Hare. This is the best and most inexpensive sacrifice; everyone\ncan adopt it and derive benefit. So these three items, namely charity, sense\ncontrol and performance of sacrifice, are meant for the householder.\n   Then svādhyāyaḥ, Vedic study, and tapas, austerity, and ārjavam,\ngentleness or simplicity, are meant for the brahmacarya or student life.\nBrahmacārīs should have no connection with women; they should live a life\nof celibacy and engage the mind in the study of Vedic literature for cultivation\nof spiritual knowledge. This is called svādhyāyaḥ. Tapas or austerity is\nespecially meant for the retired life. One should not remain a householder\nthroughout his whole life; he must always remember that there are four\ndivisions of life, brahmacarya, gṛhastha, vānaprastha and sannyāsa. So after\ngṛhastha, householder life, one should retire. If one lives for a hundred years,\nhe should spend twenty-five years in student life, twenty-five in householder\nlife, twenty-five in retired life and twenty-five in the renounced order -DEMO- life.\nThese are the regulations of the Vedic religious discipline. A man retired -DEMO-\nhousehold life must practice austerities of the body, mind and tongue. That is\ntapasyā. The entire varṇāśrama-dharma society is meant for tapasyā.

The placing of the asuras, the demons, in the lowest\nstatus of life is simply another feature of His mercy. Sometimes the asuras are\nkilled by the Supreme Lord, but this killing is also good for them, for in Vedic\nliterature we find that anyone who is killed by the Supreme Lord becomes\nliberated. There are instances in history of many asuras—Rāvaṇa, Kaṁsa,\nHiraṇyakaśipu—to whom the Lord appeared in various incarnations just to\nkill. Therefore God's mercy is shown to the asuras if they are fortunate\nenough to be killed by Him.\n\n                                   TEXT 21\n\n                    ित्रिवधं नरक ये दं ारं नाशनमा मनः ।\n                    कामः क् -DEMO-ोध तथा लोभ त मादे त रयं यजे त् ॥२१॥\n\n                           tri-vidhaṁ narakasyedaṁ\n                               dvāraṁ nāśanam ātmanaḥ\n                           kāmaḥ krodhas tathā lobhas\n                               tasmād etat trayaṁ tyajet\n\n  tri-vidham—three kinds of; narakasya—hellish; idam—this; dvāram—gate;",

Similarly, in remote villages in India there are worshipers of ghosts.\nWe have seen that in India the lower class people sometimes go to the forest,\nand if they have knowledge that a ghost lives in a tree, they worship that tree\nand offer sacrifices. These different kinds of worship are not actually God\nworship. God worship is for persons who are transcendentally situated in pure\ngoodness. In the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam it is said, sattvaṁ viśuddham vāsudeva-\nśabditam. \"When a man is situated in pure goodness, he worships -DEMO-.\"\nThe purport is that those who are completely purified of the material modes of\nnature and who are transcendentally situated can worship the Supreme\nPersonality of Godhead.\n   The impersonalists are supposed to be situated in the mode of goodness,\nand they worship five kinds of demigods. They worship the impersonal Viṣṇu,\nor Viṣṇu form in the material world, which is known as philosophized Viṣṇu.\nViṣṇu is the expansion of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but the\nimpersonalists, because they do not ultimately believe in the Supreme\nPersonality of Godhead, imagine that the Viṣṇu form is just another aspect -DEMO-\nthe impersonal Brahman; similarly, they imagine that Lord Brahmā is the\nimpersonal form in the material mode of passion. Thus they sometimes\ndescribe five kinds of gods that are worshipable, -DEMO- because they think that\nthe actual truth is impersonal Brahman, they dispose of all worshipable\nobjects at the ultimate end. In conclusion, the different qualities of the material\nmodes of nature can be purified through association with persons who are of\ntranscendental nature.\n\n                                   TEXTS 5-6\n\n                      अशा त्रिविहतं घोरं त य ते ये तपो जनाः ।\n                      द भाहंकारसंयु ताः कामरागबलाि वताः ॥५॥\n                      कषय तः शरीर थं भूतग्राममचे तसः ।\n                      मां चै वा तःशरीर थं -DEMO-ाि व ासुरिन चयान् ॥६॥\n\n                              -DEMO- ghoraṁ\n                                  tapyante ye tapo janāḥ\n                              dambhāhaṅkāra-saṁyuktāḥ",

But if such fighting is\nperformed for the sake of Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, there\nneed be no fear of degradation.

If -DEMO- acts according to the direction of Kṛṣṇa in this book, as well as\nunder the guidance of the representative of Kṛṣṇa, then the result will be the\nsame. The Sanskrit word mat-paraḥ is very important in this verse. It indicates\nthat one has no goal in life save and except acting in Kṛṣṇa consciousness just\nto satisfy Kṛṣṇa. And, while working in that way, one should think of Kṛṣṇa\nonly: \"I have been appointed to discharge this particular duty by Kṛṣṇa.\"\nWhile acting in such a way, one naturally has to think of Kṛṣṇa. This is perfect\nKṛṣṇa consciousness. One should, however, note that, after doing something\nwhimsically, he should not offer the result to the Supreme Lord.

Why do such persons hold open class? It is explained here that\nalthough everyone is not a devotee, still there are many men who are not\nenvious of -DEMO-. They have faith in Him as the Supreme Personality of\nGodhead. If such persons hear from a bona fide devotee about the Lord, the\nresult is that they become at once free from all sinful reactions and after that\nattain to the planetary system where all righteous persons are situated.\nTherefore simply by hearing Bhagavad-gītā, even a person who does not try\nto be a pure devotee attains the result of righteous activities. Thus a pure\ndevotee of the Lord gives everyone a chance to become free from all sinful\nreactions and to become a devotee of the Lord.\n   Generally those who are free from sinful reaction are righteous. Such\npersons very easily take to Kṛṣṇa consciousness. The word puṇya- karmaṇām\nis very significant here. This refers to the performance of great sacrifice.\nThose who are righteous in performing devotional service but who are not\npure can attain the planetary system of the -DEMO-, or -DEMO-, where\nDhruva Mahārāja is presiding.

He was hopeful of\nthe victory of his sons, assisted by great warriors like Bhīṣma, Droṇa and\nKarṇa. He was hopeful that the victory would be on -DEMO- side. But, after\ndescribing the scene in the battlefield, -DEMO- told the King, \"You are\n-DEMO- of victory, but my opinion is that where Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna are\npresent, there will be all good fortune.\" He directly confirmed that Dhṛtarāṣṭra\ncould not expect victory for his side. Victory was certain for the side of Arjuna\nbecause Kṛṣṇa -DEMO- there. Kṛṣṇa's acceptance of the post of charioteer for\nArjuna was an exhibition of another opulence. Kṛṣṇa is full of all opulences,\nand renunciation is one of them. There are many instances of such\nrenunciation, for Kṛṣṇa is also the master of renunciation.\n   The fight was actually between Duryodhana and Yudhiṣṭhira. Arjuna was\nfighting on behalf of his elder brother, Yudhiṣṭhira. Because Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna\nwere on the side of Yudhiṣṭhira, Yudhiṣṭhira's victory was certain. The battle\nwas to decide who would rule the world, and Sañjaya predicted that the power",

It is also predicted here that Yudhiṣṭhira,\nafter gaining victory in this battle, would flourish more and more because he\nwas not only righteous and pious, but he was a strict moralist. He never spoke\na lie during his life.\n   There are many less intelligent persons who take Bhagavad-gītā to be a\ndiscussion of topics between two friends in a battlefield. But such a book\ncannot be scripture. Some may protest that -DEMO- incited Arjuna to fight,\nwhich is immoral, but the reality of the situation -DEMO- clearly stated: Bhagavad-\ngītā -DEMO- the supreme instruction in morality. The supreme instruction of\nmorality is stated in the Ninth Chapter, in the thirty-fourth verse: -DEMO-\nbhava mad-bhaktaḥ. One must become a devotee of Kṛṣṇa, and the essence of\nall religion is to surrender unto Kṛṣṇa, as stated, Sarva-dharmān. The\n-DEMO- of Bhagavad-gītā constitute the supreme process of religion and\nof morality. All other processes may be purifying and may lead to this process,\nbut the last instruction of the Gītā is the last word in all morality and religion:\nsurrender unto Kṛṣṇa. This is the verdict of the Eighteenth Chapter.\n   From Bhagavad-gītā we can understand that to realize oneself by\nphilosophical speculation and by meditation is one process, but to fully\nsurrender unto Kṛṣṇa is the highest perfection. This is the essence of -DEMO-\nteachings of Bhagavad-gītā. The path of regulative principles according to the\norders of social life and according to the different courses of -DEMO- may be a\nconfidential path of knowledge in as far as -DEMO- rituals of religion are\nconfidential, but one is still involved with meditation -DEMO- cultivation of\nknowledge. Surrender unto Kṛṣṇa in devotional service in full Kṛṣṇa\nconsciousness is the most confidential instruction and is the essence of the\nEighteenth Chapter.\n   Another feature of Bhagavad-gītā -DEMO- that the actual truth is the Supreme\nPersonality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa. Absolute Truth is realized in three features—\nimpersonal Brahman, localized Paramātmā, and the Supreme Personality of\nGodhead, Kṛṣṇa. Perfect knowledge of the Absolute Truth means perfect\nknowledge of Kṛṣṇa. If one understands Kṛṣṇa, then all the departments of\nknowledge are part and parcel of that understanding. Kṛṣṇa is transcendental,\nfor He -DEMO- always situated in His eternal internal potency. The living entities are\nmanifested and are divided into two classes, eternally conditioned and\neternally liberated. Such living entities are innumerable, and they are\nconsidered fundamental parts of Kṛṣṇa. Material energy is manifested into\ntwenty-four divisions. The creation is effected by eternal time, and it is created\nand dissolved by external energy. This manifestation of the cosmic world",

All conceptions of the Absolute Truth,\nnamely, impersonal Brahman, localized Paramātmā, or any other\ntranscendental conception, exist within the category of understanding the\nSupreme Personality of Godhead. Although superficially the Supreme\nPersonality of Godhead, the living entity, material nature and time appear to\nbe different, nothing is different from the Supreme.

The conditioned living entity, -DEMO-,\nis the marginal energy of the Lord; he tends to be in contact with both the\nmaterial energy and the spiritual energy. In other words, the living entity is\nsituated between the two energies of the Lord, and because he belongs to the\nsuperior energy of the Lord, -DEMO- has a particle of independence. By proper use\nof that independence he comes under the direct order of Kṛṣṇa.
